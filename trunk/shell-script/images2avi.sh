# images2avi.sh - Create an AVI video from a stack of images
#
# Usage:
#
#    ./images2avi.sh file1.jpg [file2.jpg...]
#    ./images2avi.sh file1.tif [file2.tif...]
#    ./images2avi.sh file1.png [file2.png...]
#
# The output in the current directory will be:
#
#    * A video file called out.avi.
#
#    * A temp directory with a name with the format images2avi.XXXXXXXX
#      that contains the resized JPEG files from which the video is
#      created.
#
# In principle, any supported image type by ImageMagick can be
# used. File formats can be mixed too, as all formats will be
# converted to JPEG before creating the video.
#
# For the moment, this script does not accept input arguments. If you
# want to change the internal parameters:
#
#    * frame rate=25
#    * name of output file=out.avi
#    * horizontal number of pixels=640).
#
# you need to edit this script.
