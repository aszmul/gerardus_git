 * @brief  all variables full strong LP branching rule
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * The all variables full strong branching rule applies strong branching to every non-fixed variable
 * at the current node of the branch-and-bound search. The rule selects the candidate
 * which will cause the highest gain of the dual bound in the created sub-tree among all branching variables.
 *
 * For calculating the gain, a look-ahead is performed by solving the child node LPs which will result
 * from branching on a variable.
 *
 * For a more mathematical description and a comparison between the strong branching rule and other branching rules
 * in SCIP, we refer to
