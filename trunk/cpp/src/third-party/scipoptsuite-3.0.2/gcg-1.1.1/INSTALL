In order to use GCG, you need a running version of SCIP and you need
to create a (soft-)link "scip" in the lib/ directory pointing to the
main directory of your SCIP version (e.g., "../../scip").

If you do not create the soft link yourself, the Makefile will ask you
where SCIP is located. You need a recent version of SCIP (for GCG 1.0.0
this is SCIP 3.0.0).

The Makefile options are the same as in SCIP, for a detailed description
of those, have a look at the INSTALL file in your SCIP directory.

The compilation only works if SCIP was previously compiled with exactly
the same options. For example, if you want to compile in optimized
compilation mode and use Soplex as LP solver, you should first compile SCIP
via "make OPT=opt LPS=spx", then switch to the GCG directory and compile
GCG with "make OPT=opt LPS=spx", too.
The GCG makefile also provides the possibility to compile SCIP from your
GCG directory via the "SCIP" target, e.g., "make OPT=opt LPS=spx scip".

GCG is currently only tested on GNU/Linux and may not compile under
Microsoft Windows.

You can create the documentation via "make doc". Please visit
doc/html/index.html with your favorite web browser. You need doxygen 1.8.0
to build the documentation.
