function [d, p] = dijkstra(g, s)
% DIJKSTRA  Shortests path tree from sparse matrix graph
%
% [D, P] = DIJKSTRA(G, S)
%
%   This function computes the shortest distance tree(s) from one (or more)
%   source node(s) in a graph.
%
%   G is a sparse matrix where element (i,j) contains the cost of going
%   from node i to node j in the graph. That is, G contains the edge
%   weights or distances between nodes.
%
%   Note: Matlab's convention is that the absence of an element in a sparse
%   matrix means edge weight = 0. However, in this function, the lack of an
%   entry in the sparse matrix is understood as a lack of edge (or edge
%   weight = Inf).
%
%   S is a vector with a list of source nodes. A shortest path tree will be
%   computed for 
%
%   D, P are matrices where each row corresponds to a source node in S. D
%   is the shortest distance from each node to the source node.
%
%   P is the predecessor of each node in the shortest path tree.
%
%   Because this function is implemented as a MEX function in C++,
%   takes a sparse matrix at the input, and uses a Fibonacci heap
%   implementation [1], it is well suited for huge sparse graphs.
