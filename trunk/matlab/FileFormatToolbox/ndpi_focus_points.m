function x = ndpi_focus_points(file)
% NDPI_FOCUS_POINTS  Read focus points coordinates from .ndpi image file
% obtained from a Hamamatsu microscope.
%
% X = ndpi_focus_points(FILE)
%
%   FILE is a string with the path and name of an .ndpi file. This is the
%   format used by Hamamatsu microscopes.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix with the coordinates of the focus points used by
%   the microscope to acquire the image in FILE (in case of multi-image,
%   focus points for the first image, which is the one with the highest
%   resolution, are acquired). Units are meters.
