function WriteRawFile(filename, img)
% WRITERAWFILE  Write the binary part of a MetaImage file (.raw)
%
% WRITERAWFILE(FILENAME, IMG, RESOLUTION)
%
%   FILENAME is a string with the path and name of the output file.
%
%   IMG is a 3D matrix that contains the image volume. Note that it is
%   expected that x-coordinates are in the first dimension (rows),
%   y-coordinates are in the second dimension (columns). Meanwhile,
%   the Matlab convention is that x-coordinates are in columns and
%   y-coordinates are in rows.
