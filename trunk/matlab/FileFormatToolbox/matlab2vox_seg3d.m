function matlab2vox_seg3d( path_filename )
% MATLAB2VOX_SEG3D  Convert Matlab file with Seg3D segmentation to vox
% format (for the Tarantula meshing application)
%
% MATLAB2VOX_SEG3D( PATH_FILENAME )
%
%   PATH_FILENAME is a string with the full path and filename for a Matlab
%   file created with Seg3D that contains a 3D segmentation.
