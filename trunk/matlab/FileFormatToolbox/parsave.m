function parsave(filename, varargin)
% parsave  Save workspace variables to file within a parfor loop.
%
% parsave(FILENAME, VAR1[, VAR2, ...])
%
%   Matlab's save() function cannot be used within a parfor loop of the
%   Parallel Computing Toolbox. This function bridges that gap.
%
%   FILENAME is a string with the path and filename to the file where the
%   variables will be saved to.
%
%   VAR1, VAR2, ... is a list of variables (note, the variables themselves,
%   not the name of the variables).
%
%   A comparison of save() vs. parsave(). Note the differences:
%
%     save('data.mat', 'tri', 'x')
%     parsave('data.mat', tri, x)
%
% This function is an extension of
% http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30778-parsave
% to any number of variables.
