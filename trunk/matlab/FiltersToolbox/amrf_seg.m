function [block, mfg, mbg] = amrf_seg(im, blocklen, overlap)
% AMRF_SEG  Adaptive Markov Random Field segmentation.
%
%   Note: This function is in development, and can produce "blocky"
%   segmentations.
%
%   This function splits an image into blocks, estimates typical background
%   and foreground intensities, and uses them to seed a Markov Random Field
%   segmentation algorithm from the Insight Toolbox (itk::MRFImageFilter).
%
% BW = amrf_seg(IM, BLOCKLEN)
%
%   IM is a 3D array with grayscale intesity values, forming a 3D image
%   (e.g. Magnetic Resonance). The background is assumed to be light
%   (higher intensity values), and the foreground dark (lower intensity
%   values).
%
%   IM is split into blocks to estimate the typical foreground and
%   background intensity values.
%
%   BLOCKLEN is a 3-vector with the number of rows, columns and slices in
%   each block. If an integer number of blocks does not fit in the image,
%   the last blocks in each dimension are cropped.
%
%   BW is a binary segmentation of IM. Foreground voxels = 1, and
%   background voxels = 0.
%
% [..., MFG, MBG] = amrf_seg(..., OVERLAP)
%
%   To improve the smoothness of the segmentation result, we don't want
%   sudden changes in the MUFG, MUGB between neighbouring blocks.
%
%   OVERLAP is a 3-vector with the number of rows, columns and slices added
%   on each side of each block so that it overlaps with its neighbours. By
%   default, OVERLAP = [0 0 0] (no overlap is used). Note that large
%   overlaps will increase the memory used by this function substantially.
%
%   MFG, MBG are 3D arrays with the typical (modes) foreground and
%   background intensities for each of the estimation blocks.
