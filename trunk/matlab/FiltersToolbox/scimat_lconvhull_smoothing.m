function [tri, x, scimat] = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(scimat, rad, raster)
% SCIMAT_LCONVHULL_SMOOTHING  Mesh and rasterization of the smoothing of a
% binary image using a local convex hull.
%
% [TRI, X] = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(SCIMAT, RAD)
%
%   SCIMAT is a SCI MAT volume with a binary image. This binary image is
%   assumed to have one closed surface only.
%
%   An alpha-shape of the coordinates of all perimeter voxels is computed.
%   The boundary of the alpha-shape is a triangular mesh. Non-manifold
%   vertices are identified and removed iteratively, until all vertices are
%   manifold.
%
%   All vertices that were identified as non-manifold are removed from the
%   list of perimeter voxels, and the alpha-shape is recomputed. This
%   process is repeated iteratively until the result is an alpha-shape with
%   only manifold vertices.
%
%   RAD is a scalar with the radius of the alpha shape, i.e. the size of
%   the convex hull neighbourhood. When the convex hull is computed, only
%   voxels within RAD distance can be connected. When RAD=Inf, the
%   convex hull is obtained. Note that if you want to compare to other
%   alpha shape functions, e.g. cgal_alpha_shape3() or
%   cgal_fixed_alpha_shape3(), ALPHA=RAD^2.
%
%   The output is a triangular mesh described by TRI, X.
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
%   of a vertex on the surface, indexed by TRI values.
%
% [TRI, X, SCIMAT2] = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(SCIMAT, RAD, RASTER)
%
%   This syntax computes a binary rasterization of the mesh too. Note that
%   these voxels are _added_ to whatever previous segmentation was present
%   in SCIMAT.
%
%   RASTER is a string with the rasterization method:
%
%     'cgal_insurftri' (default): More reliable, although much slower.
%
%     'itk_tri_rasterization': Fast, although sometimes lines or regions of
%     voxels that should be set to 1 are set to 0.
%
%
% This function uses alphavol() by Jonas Lundgren, which is faster than the
% alpha shape functions in the CGAL library because the latter need to use
% a rather slow Delaunay triangulation first.
%
% See also: alphavol, cgal_insurftri, itk_tri_rasterization,
% cgal_alpha_shape3, cgal_fixed_alpha_shape3, scimat_tri_to_raster.
