function nrrd2 = scinrrd_papillary_muscles(nrrd, NPAPS)
% SCINRRD_PAPILLARY_MUSCLES  Extract the papillay muscles from a
% segmentation of the Left Ventricle's cavity
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_PAPILLARY_MUSCLES(NRRD)
%
%   This function extracts a segmentation of the papillary muscles from the
%   segmentation of a Left Ventricular cavity. In fact, the papillary
%   muscles are extraced, plus some bits of the wall that don't belong to
%   them, and instead of stopping at the chordae tendineae, the
%   segmentation continues and selects some trabeculations.
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct with the segmentation.
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_PAPILLARY_MUSCLES(NRRD, NPAPS)
%
%   NPAPS is a constant with the number of papillary muscles we want to
%   extract. By default, NPAPS=2.
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
