function [mfg, mbg] = im_modes(im)
% IM_MODES  Estimate typical values (modes) of foreground/background
% intensities in a greyscale image.
%
% [MFG, MBG] = im_modes(IM)
%
%   IM is an N-array of grayscale intensity values.
%
%   MFG, MBG are scalars with the typical intensity values of foreground
%   (darker) and foreground (lighter) voxels. "Typical" means the mode of
%   the corresponding distributions.
%
%   The modes are estimated by computing histograms with up to 500 bins for
%   the intensity values, and smoothing the distribution until only 1 or 2
%   peaks are visible. In case of 1 peak, it is assume that the image
%   contains only background voxels, and MFG=NaN.
