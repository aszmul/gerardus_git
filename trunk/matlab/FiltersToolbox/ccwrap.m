function varargout = ccwrap(f, varargin)
% CCWRAP  Wrapper that enables CTRL+C interruption of MEX files
%
% Matlab code (.m) can be interrupted by the user pressing the keys CTRL+C.
% This is not the case with MEX functions (e.g. C++ code compiled to run as
% a MEX function).
%
% To overcome this limitation, this function can be used as a wrapper that
% enables CTRL+C interruption of MEX functions.
%
% Note that this wrapper prevents memory leaks. Even if your C++ code
% allocates memory using functions other than Matlab's
% mxCreateDoubleMatrix, mxCreateNumericArray, etc, it will run your MEX
% function on  a worker from the Parallel Toolbox. When the computations
% finish (or CTRL+C is pressed), the worker is closed, and all memory is
% released.
%
% VARARGOUT = ccwrap(@F, VARARGIN)
%
%   @F is a function handle to the MEX function.
%
%   VARARGIN is the list of input arguments to function F.
%
%   VARARGOUT is the list of output arguments from function F.
%
% Example:
%
%   % this MEX function cannot be interrupted pressing CTRL+C
%   im2 = itk_imfilter('bwdilate', 3, 1);
%
%   % this MEX function now can be interrupted pressing CTRL+C
%   im2 = ccwrap(@itk_imfilter, 'bwdilate', 3, 1);
