function [psf, n] = typicalpsf(im, sidesz, thr, minsz)
% TYPICALPSF  Estimate point spread function from microbeads image
%
% PSF = TYPICALPSF(IM, SIDESZ, THR, MINSZ)
%
%   PSF is an array with dimensions 2*SIDESZ+1 that contains the estimation
%   of the typical point spread function (PSF) obtained from IM.
%
%   IM is an array with an image of microbeads or any other spheres small
%   enough to be under the resolution power of the optical system, so that
%   their image can be considered roughly the PSF of the sytem plus some
%   noise.
%
%   THR is a scalar with the noise level. Any voxel with intensity < THR
%   will be made 0. By default, THR = QUANTILE(IM, .99). This assumes an
%   image with some bright points, but mostly background.
%
%   MINSZ is a scalar with the minimum size of a bead connected component
%   in voxels. Smaller components will be considered noise. By default,
%   MINSZ=4.
%
%   This function finds each potential bead in the image and counts the
%   number of voxels it contains. Only beads with size between the 1st and
%   3rd quantiles (25% to 75%) are kept. Those are aligned at their maximum
%   intensity, and then the median is used to find the typical value of
%   each voxel in the PSF.
%
%   It is necessary to provide an estimate of the bead image size. SIDESZ
%   contains the number of voxels at each side of the centre. That is, we
%   assume that the PSF is negligible beyond a box of size 2*SIDESZ+1.
%
% [PSF, N] = TYPICALPSF(...)
%
%   N is a scalar with the number of beads that were used to estimate the
%   PSF.
