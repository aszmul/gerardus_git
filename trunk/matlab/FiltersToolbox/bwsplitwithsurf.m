function bw = bwsplitwithsurf(bw)
% BWSPLITWITHSURF  Split a volume into connected components separated by a
% surface
%
% BW2 = bwsplitwithsurf(BW)
%
%   BW is a 3-d segmentation that represents a curved surface. Background
%   voxels are equal to 0, and surface voxels are equal to 1.
%
%   BW2 is a segmentation of the same size as BW, where now all voxels to
%   one side of the surface are 0 and all voxels to the other side are 1.
