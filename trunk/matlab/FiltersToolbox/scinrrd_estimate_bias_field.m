function [nrrd, sigma] = scinrrd_estimate_bias_field(nrrd, x, a, sigma, FASTINTERP)
% SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD  Estimate MRI bias field
%
%   This function provides an estimate of the bias field from a magnetic
%   resonance image (MRI).
%
%   The function samples an SCI NRRD image in locations provided by the
%   user (typically, corresponding to background voxels), and then creates
%   another image that interpolates the sampled intensity values.
%
%   The locations can be selected e.g. using our Spline Tool extension to
%   the Seg3D platform (click the points, and then export the control
%   points).
%
%   Note that the interpolant is an interpolating thin-plate spline (TPS),
%   but instead of just sampling the selected voxels, a neighbourhood is
%   sampled, and used to locally low-pass filter the image with a Gaussian
%   filter. Thus, this function is somehow robust in the presence of noise.
%   Alternatively, this function could use an approximating TPS instead of
%   an interpolating one.
%
% NRRD2 = SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD(NRRD, X)
%
%   NRRD is an image provided in SCI NRRD format.
%
%   X is a 3-colum matrix with the real world coordinates of the sampling
%   points. Note that each point is rounded to the closest voxel centre.
%
%   NRRD2 is the estimated bias field in SCI NRRD format.
%
% NRRD2 = SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD(NRRD, X, A, SIGMA, FASTINTERP)
%
%   A is a scaling factor. Because using the TPS to interpolate all voxels
%   can be rather slow, and the bias field is anyway a slow varying field,
%   it's convenient to first quickly reduce the image size by A (using
%   bilinear interpolation), interpolate the bias field in the smaller
%   image with the TPS, and then expand to the original size. By default, A
%   = 1.0 and no rescaling is used. If A has 1 value, then the same scaling
%   is applied to all dimensions. If A has 3 values, each value is used to
%   scale one dimension.
%
%   SIGMA is the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter. By default,
%   sigma = 2*sqrt(-2 ln(alpha)) / a, alpha=1/sqrt(2)*ones(1,3), so that
%   the Gaussian filter has a 3dB drop at the cut-off frequency in each
%   dimension (see Note 1 for details).
%
%   FASTINTERP is a boolean to decide whether fast (more memory consuming)
%   thin-plate spline interpolation should be used. By default,
%   FASTINTERP=true. If you run out of memory, try setting it to false.
%
% [NRRD2, SIGMA] = ...
%
%   SIGMA as an output is the sigma value (in voxel units) used for the
%   Gaussian filter.
%
% ======
% Note 1
% ======
%
% The Gaussian filter in the frequency domain is
%
%   F(u) = 1/sqrt(2*pi) * exp(-u^2 *sigma^2 / 2)
%
% So if we want our filter to have a drop alpha at cut-off frequency B'
%
%   exp(-B'^2 * sigma^2 / 2) = alpha
%
% then
%
%   sigma = sqrt(-2 ln(alpha)) / B'
%
% Because of the Nyquist theorem, in order to prevent aliasing, we require
% the cut-off frequency to be
%
%   B' < fs' / 2 = a / (2*dx)
%
% then the standard deviation for the Gaussian must be
%
%   sigma > 2*sqrt(-2 ln(alpha)) / fs
%
%   sigma > 2*sqrt(-2 ln(alpha)) * dx / a
%
% There are two free parameters:
%
%   * alpha: filter drop at cut-off frequency (alpha=1/sqrt(2) makes a 3 dB
%            cut-off point)
%
%   * a: scaling factor for the image (a=.5, image becomes half size)
%
%  and a parameter that depends on the image
%
%   * dx: voxel size, image resolution; because sigma is given in pixel
%     units, dx = 1 for any image.
%
% ======
% Note 2
% ======
%
% The Gaussian filter in the space domain is
%
%   f(x) = 1/(sqrt(2*pi)*sigma) * exp(-x^2 / (2*sigma^2))
%
% The Gaussian tails tend asymptotically to 0, so we need to truncate the
% filter at some point. For sigma = 1.0, the filter tail at
% f(4)=1.3383e-04, which is a good compromise between having a small
% numerical error and a small filter.
