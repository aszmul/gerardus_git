% CORRECT_RV_CRESCENT_TIPS  Correct the segmentation of the Right
% Ventricle's crescent tips using the segmentation of the tricuspid and
% pulmonary annula
%
% TIPS = CORRECT_RV_CRESCENT_TIPS(TIPS, VALVE)
%
%   TIPS is a 3-column matrix with the coordinates of all the points in the
%   Right Ventricle crest, that corresponds to the crescent shape tips when
%   you cut the ventricle by an axial plane.
%
%   VALVE is a 3-colum matrix with the coordinates of either the tricuspid
%   valve or pulmonary valve segmetations.
%
%   The points in the segmentations are assumed to be consecutive.
%
% TIPS = CORRECT_RV_CRESCENT_TIPS(TIPS, VALVE, DTHR)
%
%   DTHR is the threshold distance value between the crest line and the
%   valve.
