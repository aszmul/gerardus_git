function tis = trimatria(tis, surf)
% TRIMATRIA  Remove the atria from a whole cardiac tissue segmentation
%
% TIS2 = trimatria(TIS, SURF)
%
%   TIS is a 3D segmentation of a whole heart (voxels==0 correspond to
%   background, and voxels==1 correspond to tissue).
%
%   SURF is a 3D segmentation of the atrio-ventricular surface that
%   separates the ventricles from the atria.
%
%   TIS2 is TIS after having removed the atria from the segmentation, as
%   well as smaller non-connected components.
