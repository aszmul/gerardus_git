function [tip1, tip2] = scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips(nrrd, m)
% SCINRRD_RV_CRESCENT_TIPS  Extract the tips of the crescent-shaped curve
% in all slices of the Right Ventricle
%
% [X1, X2] = SCINRRD_RV_CRESCENT_TIPS(NRRD, M)
%
%   X1, X2 are 3-colum matrices where each row are the real world
%   coordinates of each of the tips of the RV crescent shape.
%
%   NRRD is the struct with the RV segmentation mask.
%
%   M is a 3-column matrix, where each row has the real world coordinates
%   of a centroid (typically, the central Left Ventricle's central curve
%   computed with scinrrd_centroids()). There must be as many centroids as
%   slices. Centroids with NaN coordinates will be skipped.
%
%   In the case of a RV slice that has no corresponding LV centroid, the
%   closest LV centroid will be used.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
