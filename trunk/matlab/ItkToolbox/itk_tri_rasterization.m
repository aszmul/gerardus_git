function varargout = itk_tri_rasterization(varargin)
% ITK_TRI_RASTERIZATION  Rasterization of triangular mesh to binary
% segmentation
%
% This function provides a Matlab interface to
% itk::TriangleMeshToBinaryImageFilter.
%
% BW = itk_tri_rasterization(TRI, X, RES, SIZE, ORIGIN)
%
%   TRI, X describe a triangular mesh.
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
%   of a vertex on the surface, indexed by TRI values.
%
%   RES is a 3-vector with the voxel size in (row, column, slice) format.
%
%   SIZE is a 3-vector with the number of voxels in (row, column, slice)
%   format.
%
%   ORIGIN is a 3-vector with the coordinates of the centre of the
%   bottom-left image voxel, in (x, y, z) format.
%
%   BW is the output uint8 binary segmentation. Voxels inside the mesh will
%   be set to 1, and voxels outside to 0. Note that voxels with their
%   centre exactly on the mesh offer different results depending on whether
%   they are at the left, right, top or bottom of the mesh. This is a
%   limitation in itk::TriangleMeshToBinaryImageFilter. See
%   test_itk_tri_rasterization.m in Gerardus for an example.
