% ITK_PSTRANSFORM: Spatial transformation (i.e. warp) of a set of points,
% defined from a known landmark correspondence
%
% This MEX-function provides a Matlab interface to run ITK's Kernel
% and B-spline transforms:
%
%   itk::ElasticBodySplineKernelTransform
%   itk::ElasticBodyReciprocalSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::ThinPlateSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::ThinPlateR2LogRSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::VolumeSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::BSplineScatteredDataPointSetToImageFilter
%
%
% YI = itk_pstransform(TRANSFORM, X, Y, XI)
%
%   X, Y are 2-column (2D) or 3-column (3D) matrices. Each row has
%   the coordinates of a point. The warp is defined so that
%   X(i,:)->Y(i,:).
%
%   XI is a matrix with the same number of columns as X, Y. Each row
%   has the coordinates of a point to be warped.
%
%   YI has the same dimensions as XI. YI contains the coordinates of
%   the warped points.
%
%   TRANSFORM is a string that allows to select the type of warp (no
%   defaults):
%
% YI = itk_pstransform('elastic', X, Y, XI)
% YI = itk_pstransform('elasticr', X, Y, XI)
% YI = itk_pstransform('tps', X, Y, XI)
% YI = itk_pstransform('tpsr2', X, Y, XI)
% YI = itk_pstransform('volume', X, Y, XI)
%
%   'elastic':  itk::ElasticBodySplineKernelTransform
%   'elasticr': itk::ElasticBodyReciprocalSplineKernelTransform
%   'tps':      itk::ThinPlateSplineKernelTransform
%   'tpsr2':    itk::ThinPlateR2LogRSplineKernelTransform
%   'volume':   itk::VolumeSplineKernelTransform
%
%   Note that 'tpsr2' produces the same result as our Matlab implementation
%   pts_tps_map(), as it implements the classic kernel proposed by
%   Bookstein, r^2 ln(r^2).
%
% YI = itk_pstransform('bspline', X, Y, XI, ORDER, LEVELS)
%
%   'bspline':  itk::BSplineScatteredDataPointSetToImageFilter

%
%   ORDER is an integer with the B-spline order. By default, ORDER=3,
%   and the B-spline is cubic.
%
%   LEVELS is an integer with the number of multi-resolution levels
%   in the algorithm. A higher number of levels will make the spline
%   more flexible and match the landmarks better. By default, LEVELS=5.
