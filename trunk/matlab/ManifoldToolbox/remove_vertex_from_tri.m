function [tri, x] = remove_vertex_from_tri(tri, x, idx)
% REMOVE_VERTEX_FROM_TRI  Remove vertices from a triangular mesh
%
% This function removes vertices from a mesh and all triangles they are
% part of. It also relabels vertex indices accordingly.
%
% [TRI2, X2] = remove_vertex_from_tri(TRI, X, IDX)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
%   of a vertex on the surface, indexed by TRI values.
%
%   IDX is a vector of vertex indices.
%
%   TRI2 and X2 are the matrices that describe the mesh after the vertices
%   have been removed.
