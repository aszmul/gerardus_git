function scimat = scimat_tri_to_raster(tri, x, scimat, raster)
% SCIMAT_TRI_TO_RASTER  Rasterize a closed triangular mesh
%
% This takes a triangular mesh and returns a raster image with voxels == 1
% inside the mesh and == 0 outside the mesh.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_closed_surf_to_bw(TRI, X, SCIMAT)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix with a triangulation of a close surface. Each
%   element in TRI is an index to a row in X. Each row represents the three
%   vertices of a triangle on the surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix with the Euclidean coordinates of the
%   triangulation vertices.
%
%   SCIMAT is the scimat-format struct with the details about the number of
%   voxels, voxel size and offset of the output raster image.
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the output, where the voxels within the closed surface have
%   been set to 1. Note that these voxels are _added_ to whatever previous
%   segmentation was present in SCIMAT.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_closed_surf_to_bw(..., RASTER)
%
%   RASTER is a string with the rasterization method:
%
%     'cgal_insurftri' (default): More reliable, although much slower.
%
%     'itk_tri_rasterization': Fast, although sometimes lines or regions of
%     voxels that should be set to 1 are set to 0.
%
