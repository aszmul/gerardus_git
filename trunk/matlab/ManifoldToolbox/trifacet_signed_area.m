function a = trifacet_signed_area(tri, x)
% TRIFACET_SIGNED_AREA  Signed area of the facets in a 2D triangulation.
%
% A = trifacet_signed_area(TRI, X)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 2-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xy-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   A is a vector where A(i) is the signed area of the i-th triangle.
%   Positive areas correspond to counter-clockwise triangles, and negative
%   areas, to clockwise triangles.
