function idx = tri_find_nonmanifold_vertex(tri, x, scimat_axis)
% TRI_FIND_NONMANIFOLD_VERTEX  Find indices of non-manifold vertices in a
% triangular mesh
%
% IDX = tri_find_nonmanifold_vertex(TRI, RCS)
%
%   This function is a hack so that we can identify which vertices
%   meshcheckrepair() identifies as non-manifold.
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   RCS is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the (row, column, slice)
%   coordinates of a vertex in the mesh.
%
%   IDX is a vector with the indices of the vertices in X that are
%   non-manifold.
%
% IDX = tri_find_nonmanifold_vertex(TRI, X, SCIMAT.AXIS)
%
%   Alternatively, vertex coordinates X can be provided as real world
%   (x,y,z) Cartesian coordinates. SCIMAT.AXIS is the axis field from a
%   SCIMAT structure with the offset and voxel size information.

% meshcheckrepair() is supposed to be used to repair a non-manifold mesh.
% What it actually does is that it duplicates non-manifold vertices, which
% I'm not sure it's a good repair. Anyway, here we are interested only in
% detecting the non-manifold vertices. We are going to do it in a bit of a
% convoluted way, because meshcheckrepair() just duplicated the vertices,
% but doesn't tell which ones they are

% run meshcheckrepair(). This will duplicate any non-manifold vertices We
% use evalc so that we can supress the output to the screen.
[~, rcs2] = evalc('meshcheckrepair(rcs, tri, ''deep'');');

% round values to avoid finite precision errors
rcs2 = round(rcs2);

% assign one index value to each unique vertex
[~, idx] = unique(rcs2, 'rows'); 

% delete all vertices except for the duplicates
rcs2(idx, :) = []; 

% sometimes a vertex may be repetead more than once. We want a list of
% unique vertices
rcs2 = unique(rcs2, 'rows'); 

% indices of non-manifold vertices
idx = find(ismember(rcs, rcs2, 'rows'));
