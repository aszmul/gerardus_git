function [lat, lon, stopCondition, err, dout, sphrad] = smdscale(d, sphrad, lat, lon, opt)
% SMDSCALE  Local neighbourhood Multidimensional scaling on a sphere
%
% This function solves a Multidimensional Scaling problem by finding a way
% to distribute (embed) a set of points on a sphere so that the matrix
% formed from the geodesic distance between connected pairs of points is as
% close as possible (in the Frobenius norm sense) to the input distance
% matrix.
%
% This function is based on the MDS optimisation idea proposed by Agarwal
% et al. (2010) for the sphere in case the error metric is raw stress
% (sigma_r) of the geodesic distances
%
%    sigma_r = sqrt(sum_{i,j} (d_ij - dout_ij)^2)
%
% No code was available with the paper, which does not provide the
% implementation details for the sphere either. Our implementation uses
% spherical trigonometry formulas to compute geodesic distances, means and
% point displacements over the sphere.
%
% The original paper assumes that the input distance matrix is full (i.e.
% all points are connected to all points). We allow for sparse input
% matrices, that represent local neighbourhoods of connectivity.
%
% [LAT, LON, STOP, ERR, DOUT, SPHRAD] = smdscale(D)
%
%   D is a square matrix where D(i,j) is some distance (e.g. in meters)
%   between points i and j. Note that the points themselves are unknown, we
%   only know the distances between them. These distances could be geodesic
%   distances, or approximations thereof, e.g. chord-length distances.
%
%   D can be a full or sparse matrix. In both cases, values of D(i,j)=0 or
%   D(i,j)=Inf mean that points i and j are not neighbours, i.e. they are
%   not connected by an edge. Whether D is full or sparse can affect
%   performance. If D has lots of zeros, it's better to input D as a sparse
%   matrix. If D has few zeros, it's better to input D as a full matrix. 
%
%   The optimisation algorithm works by relocating each point i so that its
%   new distance on the sphere to each neighbour j is as close to D(i,j) as
%   possible. Note that non-neighbours (D=0 or D=Inf) are ignored in the
%   optimisation. This allows sparse matrices and local neighbourhood
%   optimisations.
%
%   LAT, LON give the output parametrization of the unknown points. LAT,
%   LON are vectors with the latitude and longitude coordinates (in
%   radians). Note that LAT, LON is one of infinite solutions, as D is
%   invariant to rotations.
%
%   To compute the (x,y,z) Euclidean coordinates of the sphere points run
%
%     [x, y, z] = sph2cart(LON, LAT, 1);
%
%   STOP is a cell-array with the condition/s that made the algorithm stop,
%   in string form.
%
%   ERR is a struct with several error measures at each algorithm
%   iteration:
%
%     ERR.rawstress: Raw stress (sigma_r), as defined above.
%
%     ERR.stress1:   Stress-1 (sigma_1).
%
%         sigma_1 = sqrt(sigma_r / sum_{i,j} (d_ij)^2)
%
%     ERR.maxalpha:  Maximum angular displacement of any point in each
%                    iteration.
%
%     ERR.medalpha:  Median angular displacement of all points in each
%                    iteration.
%
%   DOUT is the matrix of great circle or geodesic distances between the
%   points given by LAT, LON, and SPHRAD. The great circle distance between
%   points i and j can be computed in Matlab as
%
%     dsph = distance(lat(i), lon(i), lat(j), lon(j), sphrad, 'radians');
%
%   SPHRAD is a scalar with the radius of the sphere used in the MDS
%   algorithm. Note that the radius of the sphere is a critical parameter.
%   If the sphere is too small or too large, the algorithm will produce
%   very poor results. If not provided, SPHRAD is estimated so that it can
%   accommodate the distance from each point to the most distant point.
%   Note that this requires running a full Dijkstra, which may be slow for
%   very sparse large matrices. The sphere's radius is estimated from the
%   Dijkstra distance matrix DD as:
%
%      sphrad = median(max(DD)) / pi;
%
%   where DD=dijkstra(sparse(D), 1:N);
%
% [...] = smdscale(D, SPHRAD, LAT0, LON0, OPT)
%
%   SPHRAD can be provided by the user, in which case it is not estimated
%   internally.
%
%   LAT0, LON0 are the user's initial guess for the latitude and longitude
%   of the point configuration. By default, a configuration of points
%   randomly distributed over the sphere is used.
%
%   OPT is a struct with the stop conditions for the algorithm. The
%   algorithm stops when any of the stop conditions are met. The following
%   conditions are available:
%
%     opt.MaxIter: (default = 20) maximum number of iterations we allow the
%                  optimisation algorithm. Each iteration consists of an
%                  entire sweep of all points on the sphere.
%
%     opt.MaxAlpha: alpha is the angular distance (in radians) that each
%                   output point is moved in an iteration. The algorithm
%                   will stop if no point has been moved more than MaxAlpha
%                   radians.
