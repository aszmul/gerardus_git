function d = chord2arclen(d, R)
% CHORD2ARCLEN  Euclidean chord length distances to sphere arc length
% distances.
%
% DARCLEN = chord2arclen(DCHORD, R)
%
%   DCHORD is a scalar, vector, matrix or general array with Euclidean
%   chord length distances. Units are metres.
%
%   R is the radius of the sphere. Units are metres. By default, R=1.
%
%   DARCLEN has the same size as DCHORD, with the corresponding geodesic
%   (great circle) distances. Units are metres.
