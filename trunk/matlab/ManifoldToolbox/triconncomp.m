function [N, trilab, xlab] = triconncomp(tri, x)
% TRICONNCOMP  Find connected components in mesh
%
% [N, TRILAB, XLAB] = triconncomp(TRI, X)
%
%   Return the connected components found in the mesh described by TRI, X.
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
%   of a vertex on the surface, indexed by TRI values.
%
%   N is the number of connected components found by the algorithm.
%
%   TRILAB and XLAB are vectors that label TRI and X, respectively. The
%   label indicates which connected components they belong to.
