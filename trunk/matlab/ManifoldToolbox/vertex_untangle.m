function [x0, exitflag] = vertex_untangle(tri, x, idx0)
% VERTEX_UNTANGLE  Find 2D coordinates for a free vertex surrounded
% by a polygon of fixed counter-clockwise sorted vertices such that the
% free vertex is untangled.
%
% This function is an enhanced implementation of the 2D case (i.e. each
% simplex is a triangle) of the "Optimization-based mesh untangling"
% method proposed by Freitag and Plassmann (2000).
%
% Note that the original paper contains some errors in the formulation of
% the linear programming problem. The correct problem formulation is
%
%     max b^T \pi (equivalenty: min -b^T \pi)
%     such that -A^T \pi <= c
%
% where b = [0 0 1], A^T = [ax ay -2*ones(N, 1)], N=number of
% triangles, and ax, ay, c as given in the paper.
%
% We check whether the free vertex is already untangled. In that case, we
% do not relocate it (this is an untangling algorithm, not a mesh
% improvement or mesh smoothing algorithm).
%
% X0 = vertex_untangle(TRI, X);
%
%   Let TRI, X describe a closed fan triangular mesh. That is, we have a
%   central or free vertex connected to N neighbours. The neighbours are
%   connected between them to form a closed perimeter. The perimeter is
%   assumed to be oriented in counter-clockwise orientation (that is, if a
%   solution exists, the areas of the triangles will all be positive).
%
%   We want to find the coordinates X0 for the free vertex, such that the
%   edges that connect vertices don't overlap. The N neighbours remain
%   fixed. If the free vertex was already producing any overlaps (i.e. the
%   mesh was entangled), this can be seen as an untangling algorithm.
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh. The orientation provided by the triangles
%   will be assumed by the algorithm to the counter-clockwise, i.e. the
%   algorithm will produce a solution where all triangles have positive
%   signed areas.
%
%   X is a 2-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xy-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh. Note that Freitag and Plassmann (2000) also
%   provided the solution for the 3D case (i.e. each simplex is a
%   tetrahedron), but we haven't implemented it here yet.
%
%   X0 is a 2-vector with the optimal coordinates of the central (a.k.a.
%   free) vertex, in a linear programming sense, 
%
% [X0, EXITFLAG] = vertex_untangle(...)
%
%   EXITFLAG is the exit condition of the algorithm.
%
%     2: Free vertex was not tangled, no relocation performed.
%     1: Linear programming algorithm converged to a relocation solution.
%     0: Linear programming algorithm stopped because of maximum number of
%        iterations reached.
%    -1: Linear programming algorithm found no valid solution exists.
