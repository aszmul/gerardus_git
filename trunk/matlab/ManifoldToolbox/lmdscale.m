function [u, v, stopCondition, err, dout] = lmdscale(d, u, v, opt)
% LMDSCALE  Local neighbourhood Multidimensional scaling on a plane
%
% This function solves a Multidimensional Scaling problem finding an
% embedding in R^2 of points according to a distance matrix D. Unlike
% classical MDS, D can be a sparse matrix, that is, each point's position
% only depends on a local neighbourhood of points connected to it.
%
% This function is based on the MDS optimisation idea proposed by Agarwal
% et al. (2010) for the case when the error metric is raw stress
%
%    sigma_r = sqrt(sum_{i,j} (d_ij - dout_ij)^2)
%
% We have improved it by using an exact one-step solution to the location
% of a point at a given distance from a set of neighbours by Gower (1968),
% replacing Agarwal's iterative PLACE() algorithm.
%
% [U, V, STOP, ERR, DOUT] = lmdscale(D)
%
%   D is a square matrix where D(i,j) is some distance (e.g. in meters)
%   between points i and j. Note that the points themselves are unknown, we
%   only know the distances between them. These distances could be geodesic
%   distances, or approximations thereof, e.g. chord-length distances.
%
%   D can be a full or sparse matrix. In both cases, values of D(i,j)=0 or
%   D(i,j)=Inf mean that points i and j are not neighbours, i.e. they are
%   not connected by an edge. Whether D is full or sparse can affect
%   performance. If D has lots of zeros, it's better to input D as a sparse
%   matrix. If D has few zeros, it's better to input D as a full matrix. 
%
%   The optimisation algorithm works by relocating each point i so that its
%   new distance on R^2 to each neighbour j is as close to D(i,j) as
%   possible. Note that non-neighbours (D=0 or D=Inf) are ignored in the
%   optimisation. This allows sparse matrices and local neighbourhood
%   optimisations.
%
%   U, V give an output parametrization of the unknown points, in the same
%   units as the distances. Note that U, V is one of inifite solutions, as
%   D is invariant to translations, rotations and reflections.
%
%   STOP is a cell-array with the condition/s that made the algorithm stop,
%   in string form.
%
%   ERR is a struct with several error measures at each algorithm
%   iteration:
%
%     ERR.rawstress: Raw stress (sigma_r), as defined above.
%
%     ERR.stress1:   Stress-1 (sigma_1).
%
%         sigma_1 = sqrt(sigma_r / sum_{i,j} (d_ij)^2)
%
%     ERR.maxalpha:  Maximum angular displacement of any point in each
%                    iteration.
%
%     ERR.medalpha:  Median angular displacement of all points in each
%                    iteration.
%
%   DOUT is the matrix of Euclidean distances between the points given by
%   U, V.
%
% [...] = lmdscale(D, U0, V0, OPT)
%
%   U0, V0 are the user's initial guess for the point parametrization. By
%   default, a configuration of points randomly distributed on a
%   [0,0]x[1,1] square is used.
%
%   OPT is a struct with the stop conditions for the algorithm. The
%   algorithm stops when any of the stop conditions are met. The following
%   conditions are available:
%
%     opt.MaxIter: (default = 20) maximum number of iterations we allow the
%                  optimisation algorithm. Each iteration consists of an
%                  entire sweep of all points on the sphere.
%
%     opt.MaxInc:  inc is the Euclidean distance that each output point is
%                  moved in an iteration. The algorithm will stop if no
%                  point has been moved more than MaxInc.
