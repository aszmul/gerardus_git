function d = arclen2chord(d, R)
% ARCLEN2CHORD  Sphere arc length distances to Euclidean chord length
% distances.
%
% DCHORD = arclen2chord(DARCLEN, R)
%
%   DARCLEN is a scalar, vector, matrix or general array with geodesic
%   (great circle) distances. Units are metres.
%
%   R is the radius of the sphere. Units are metres. By default, R=1.
%
%   DCHORD has the same size as DARCLEN, with the corresponding Euclidean
%   chord length distances. Units are metres.
