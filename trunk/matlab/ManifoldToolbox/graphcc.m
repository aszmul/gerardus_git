function [N, cc] = graphcc(g)
% GRAPHCC  Split a graph into connected components.
%
% [N, CC] = GRAPHCC(G)
%
%   G is a square adjacency matrix of a graph. G(i,j)~=0 means that
%   vertices i, j are directly connected.
%
%   N is a scalar with the number of connected components in the graph.
%
%   CC is a cell array with N elements. CC{i} is a list of all the vertices
%   that belong to the i-th connected components. Vertices that belong to
%   different connected components have no paths between them in the graph.
