function [tri, latlon] = trihemisphere(N)
% TRIHEMISPHERE  Triangular mesh on hemisphere with roughly uniformly
% distributed points
%
% [TRI, LANLOT] = trihemisphere(N)
%
%   This function uses Anton Semechko's implementation of Reisz s-energy
%   minimisation to find 2*N points approximately uniformly distributed on
%   the sphere and their triangulation. Then, it keeps roughly the lower
%   hemisphere, and moves a bit the points at the top edge so that the top
%   edge has constant latitude. One of the vertices will be at the south
%   pole.
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   LANLOT is a 2-column matrix with the latitude and longitude coordinates
%   (in radians) of the mesh vertices. There will be approximately N
%   points.
%
%   The mesh can be visualised running
%
%     [tri, latlon] = trihemisphere(51);
%    [x, y, z] = sph2cart(latlon(:, 2), latlon(:, 1), 1);
%    hold off
%    trisurf(tri, x, y, z)
%    axis equal
