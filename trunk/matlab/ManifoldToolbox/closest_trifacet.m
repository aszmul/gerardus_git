function [idx, d] = closest_trifacet(tri, x, xi)
% CLOSEST_TRIFACET  Closest triangular facet of a mesh to a point in 3D
%
%  Note that this Matlab implementation is 54 times slower than the
%  C++ MEX implementation cgal_closest_trifacet() in the Right Ventricle
%  example of matlab/test/cgal_closest_trifacet.m.
%
% [IDX, D] = closest_trifacet(TRI, X, XI)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   XI is a 3-column matrix. XI(i, :) are the xyz-coordinates of a test
%   point. This function finds the facet TRI(j,:) that is closest to
%   XI(i,:).
%
%   IDX is a vector with one element per point in XI. IDX(i) is the index
%   of the closest facet to XI(:,i). For instance, to obtain the nodes of
%   the facet closest to XI(i,:), run TRI(IDX(i), :).
%
%   D is a vector with the same length as IDX. D(i) is the distance of
%   point XI(i,:) to the mesh, or equivalently, to the closest facet.
%
% Depends on pointTriangleDistance() by Gwendolyn Fischer.
