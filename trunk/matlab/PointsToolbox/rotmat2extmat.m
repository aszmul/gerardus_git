function b = rotmat2extmat(m, a, center)
% ROTMAT2EXTMAT  Convert centroid and rotation matrix pair to extended
% matrix form
%
% B = ROTMAT2EXTMAT(M, A)
%
%   A is a (3,3)-matrix that describes a rotation around a centroid M,
%   where M is a column 3-vector.
%
%     Y = A*(X - M) + M
%
%   B2 is a (4,4)-matrix that describes the same transformation in extended
%   form
%
%     [Y] = B2 [X]
%     [1]      [1]
%
%   B is B2 minus the bottom row.
%
% B = ROTMAT2EXTMAT(M, A, CENTER)
%
%   CENTER is a boolean (default CENTER=false). If true, the transformation
%   will move the centroid to 0:
%
%     Y = A*(X - M)
