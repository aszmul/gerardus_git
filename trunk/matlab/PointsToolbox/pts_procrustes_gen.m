% Analysis
%
% [YM, Y] = PTS_PROCRUSTES_GEN(X)
%
%    X is a (P,K, N)-volume of sets of points, where P is the number of
%    points with dimension K, and N the number of sets.
%
%    YM is the mean set or consensus matrix.
%
%    Y is a volume with scaled and zero centered versions of X [1].
%    Besides, sets in Y has been rotated to match YM using Least-Squares
%    Fit Orthogonal Procrustes analysis (a form of similarity registration)
%    as described in [1, pp. 44-45].
%
%    An error in [1] that caused the algorithm to oscillate and not
%    converge in some cases has been fixed.
%
% [YM, Y] = PTS_PROCRUSTES_GEN(X, TOL, VERB)
%
%    The iterative algorithm stops when the improvement in SSE is < TOL. By
%    default, TOL = 1e-4.
%
%    VERB is a flag to make the algorithm verbose and show the evolution of
%    the SSE. By default, VERB=false.
%
% [YM, Y, RHO, SSE] = PTS_PROCRUSTES_GEN(...)
%
%    RHO is a vector with N elements, that are the scale factors for each
%    set. Note: rho is _not_ the size factor between the consensus and each
%    set of points. It is an internal parameter of the algorithm [1] that
%    scales each configuration with respect to the others.
%
%    SSE is the residual sum of squares of YM.
