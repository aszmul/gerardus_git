function [x, s] = pts_cn(x)
% PTS_CN  Center and normalize sets of points

%
%    X is a volume of points, i.e. a (P, K, N)-matrix where P is the number
%    of points of K dimensions, and N is the number of sets of points.
%
%    Y is a matrix like X, but with all sets centered around the origin and
%    with the square root of the sum of the squared distances of the points
%    to the centroid equal to 1.
%
%    S is a column vector with N elements. Each one is the scaling factor
%    that has been applied to one set of points.
%
%       Y = A * X * S
%
%    where A is EYE(P) - ONES(P) / P, as described in [1].
