function t = iscollinear(x, tol)
% ISCOLLINEAR  Test to determine whether a set of points are collinear
%
% T = ISCOLLINEAR(X)
%
%   X is a (D, N)-matrix with N points of D dimension. This test works with
%   points of any dimension.
%
%   T is a boolean that says whether X is a set of collinear points.
%
% T = ISCOLLINEAR(X, TOL)
%
%   TOL is the tolerance value for collinearity. By default, TOL=1e-16.
