% FINDPEAKSN  Find local peaks (local maxima) in n-dimensional data
%
% ISPEAK = findpeaks(IM)
%
%   IM is an n-dimensional array, e.g. a vector, 2D image or 3D volume.
%
%   ISPEAK is a boolean array of the same size. True elements correspond to
%   local peaks (local maxima) in IM. A local peak must be a peak in each
%   of the n dimensions.
%
%   Note: to mirror Matlab's function findpeaks(), we consider as peaks
%   only the end of increasing slopes. So if we have a raising slope, a
%   flat region, and then a falling slope, we only consider one peak (the
%   end of the raising slope).
%
% ISPEAK = findpeaks(IM, USEDIM, MINHEIGHT, MINDIST)
%
%   USEDIM is a boolean vector with length n. Each element says whether the
%   corresponding dimension should be taken into account to define the
%   peaks. By default, USEDIM=true(1, ndims(IM)) and all dimensions are
%   taken into account.
%
%   MINHEIGHT is a scalar with the minimum value an element in IM must have
%   to be considered a peak. This can be used to reduce false positives
%   given by background noise. By default, MINHEIGHT=0 and all peaks are
%   accepted.
%
%   MINDIST is a scalar with the minimum distance (in pixel/voxel units)
%   between any two peaks. Smaller peaks too close to larger peaks can be
%   removed using this paramenter.
