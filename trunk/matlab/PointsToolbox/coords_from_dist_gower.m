% Z = COORDS_FROM_DIST_GOWER(X, D)
%
%   For 2D points, X is a (2, P)-matrix with the coordinates of P
%   landmarks. Points can have any dimension, they are not limited to being
%   2D. Note that if the points in X are collinear, the result Z will be
%   wrong in general, as the solution is not unique.
%
%   D is a P-vector with the distance of point Z to each of the landmarks.
%   D can also be a matrix, if each column is a vector of distances.
%
%   Gower(1986) showed that the coordinates of Z can be computed from X and
%   D.
%
% Z = COORDS_FROM_DIST_GOWER(X, D, TOL)
%
%   TOL is the tolerance value for the collinearity test. By default,
%   TOL=1e-16. If TOL=[], then the collinearity test is skipped.
