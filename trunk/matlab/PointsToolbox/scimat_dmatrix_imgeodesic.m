function [d2, idx, p, d] = scimat_dmatrix_imgeodesic(scimat, idx)
% SCIMAT_DMATRIX_IMGEODESIC  Compute a distance/adjacency matrix for a set
% of scattered points using the image intensity to approximate the
% geodesics
%
% D = scimat_dmatrix_imgeodesic(SCIMAT, IDX)
%
%   SCIMAT is SCI MAT struct that contains a grayscale image. The live wire
%   will try to avoid bright (white) areas, and instead select darker
%   voxels.
%
%   IDX is a 3-column matrix with the index-coordinates of the points in
%   the scattered set.
%
%   In particular, the algorithm looks for the shortest paths between pairs
%   of points in IDX, where the Euclidean distance between two adjacent
%   voxels is weighted by their mean intensity. Note that if the intensity
%   difference between background and object is small, the algorithm may
%   prefer a shorter path even if it crosses the object. Also, backgrounds
%   with intensity = 0 can produce unexpected results. Take into account
%   that in that case, any path on the background will have the same
%   cost=0.
%
%   D is a square matrix. D(i,j) is the estimated geodesic distance between
%   points i and j. This distance is purely geometric, not weighted by
%   intensity values.
%
% [D, IDX2, P, DINT] = scimat_dmatrix_imgeodesic(...)
%
%   IDX2 is a vector with the linear indices that correspond to the
%   multiple subscript indices in IDX.
%
%   P is the predecessors matrix. Each row corresponds to a point in IDX.
%   The path from target node IDX2(j) to source node IDX2(i) can be
%   backtracked using
%
%     pth = graphpred2path(p(I, :), idx2(J));
%
%  Note that, for efficiency reasons, the predecessors path is only
%  guaranteed for the nodes in IDX. For other nodes, the path may not have
%  been computed or may be suboptimal.
%
%  DINT is a distance matrix with the intensity-weighted distances from the
%  nodes in IDX to all the voxels in the image. As with P, distances are
%  only guaranteed to be correct and minimal for the nodes in IDX.
