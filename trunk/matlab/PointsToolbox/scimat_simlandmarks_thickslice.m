% SCIMAT_SIMLANDMARKS_THICKSLICE  Simulate a human placing landmarks on the
% boundary of a "thick slice" segmentation
%
% This function simulates a human placing landmarks on a segmentation when
% the slices are thick or when only one out of every n slices will be
% segmented. Each slice will have a guaranteed number of points randomly
% selected.
%
% [X, SCIMAT2] = scimat_simlandmarks_thickslice(SCIMAT, P, DIM, S)
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct with a binary segmentation.
%
%   P is a scalar with the proportion of points from the boundary of each
%   slice that will be randomly selected. By default, P=0.1 (10% of the
%   points).
%
%   DIM is the dimension along which the 2D boundaries are computed and
%   sampled. By default, DIM=3.
%
%   S is a vector with the indices of the slices that will be sampled.
