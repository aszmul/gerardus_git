function zi = mba_surface_interpolation(x, y, z, xi, yi, nlev)
% MBA_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION  Scattered data Multilevel B-spline interpolation
%
% This MEX-function uses the MBA library [1] to compute a Multilevel
% B-spline interpolated surface from a scattered set of points.
%
% ZI = mba_surface_interpolation(X, Y, Z, XI, YI, NLEV)
%
%   X, Y, Z are column vectors of the same size with the 3D
%   coordinates of a scattered set of points.
%
%   XI, YI are column vectors of the same size (but can have a
%   different size from X, Y and Z) with the 2D coordinates of the
%   locations that we want to interpolate.
%
%   ZI is a vector of the same length as XI and YI, with the
%   interpolated values.
%
%   NLEV is the number of levels in the hierarchical construction of the
%   interpolant. By default, NLEV = 7.
