function [x, xm, v, d] = pca_normalize(x)
% PCA_NORMALIZE  Normalize a set of points so that its centroid is zero,the
% Principal Components correspond to the Cartesian axes, and the variance
% (eigenvalue) along each Principal Component is one
%
% Y = pca_normalize(X)
%
%   X is a matrix where each row corresponds to a point and each column to
%   a coordinate.
%
%   Y is a matrix that corresponds to X normalized in a PCA sense. That is,
%   X is centered on zero, rotated so that its Principal Components
%   coincide with the Cartesian axes, and scaled so that the variance along
%   each axis is one.
%
% [Y, XM, V, D] = pca_normalize(X)
%
%   XM is the centroid of X.
%
%   V is matrix of Principal Components (eigenvectors) of X.
%
%   D is a vector with the variance (eigenvalues) along the Principal
%   Compoments of X.
%
%   Note that you can recover the original data set running
%
%     y = y .* repmat(sqrt(d)', size(x, 1), 1);  % unscale
%     y = y * v';                                % undo rotation
%     y = y + repmat(xm, size(x, 1), 1);         % undo centering
