function [tri, v] = cube_stackable_tessellation()
% CUBE_STACKABLE_TESSELLATION  Tessellation in tetrahedra of a cube that
% can be stacked in a regular mesh
%
% TRI = CUBE_STACKABLE_TESSELLATION()
%
%   TRI is a numt-by-4 matrix, as the one produced by Matlab's function
%   DELAUNAY3. Each row of TRI contains the indices of 4 vertices of
%   the cube that form a tetrahedron.
%
%   TRI has 6 rows, i.e. the cube in tessellated by 6 tetrahedra. This
%   tessellation makes contiguous tetrahedra match when cubes are stacked
%   together.
%
%   A cube can also be tessellated by 5 tetrahedra, or 6 in a different
%   configuration, but then the stackability is lost. For more information,
%   see e.g. http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/wessner/node32.html.
%
%   The cube's vertices have been labelled as:
%
%            6 ------------ 8
%            / |          /|
%           /  |         / |
%          /   |        /  |
%         /    |       /   |
%        5 ----------- 7   |
%         |    |------|----|
%         |   / 2     |   / 4
%         |  /        |  /
%         | /         | /
%         |/          |/
%        1 ----------- 3
%
% [TRI, V] = CUBE_STACKABLE_TESSELLATION()
%
%   V is a 3-column matrix with the coordinates of the vertices of a cube
%   in [0, 1].
%
%   You can visualize the tessellation running
%
%   >> [tri, v] = cube_stackable_tessellation();
%   >> tetramesh( tri, v )
