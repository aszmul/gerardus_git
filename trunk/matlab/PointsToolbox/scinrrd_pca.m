%
%   This function computes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
%   collection of points in a SCI NRRD segmentation mask.
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
%   V is a matrix with the column eigenvectors ordered in decreasing order
%   of the corresponding eigenvalues in D.
%
%   M is a 3-vector with the coordinates of the dataset centroid. The
%   centroid is the centre of the coordinate system defined by the
%   eigenvectors, and the centre of rotation if the data is rotated.
%
%   Assuming a 3D volume, V is a (3, 3)-matrix and D a 3-vector.
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
