function varargout = cgal_tri_fillholes(varargin)
% CGAL_TRI_FILLHOLES  Fill holes in a triangular mesh, with triangles.
%
% This function fills any holes in a triangular mesh. As holes are not
% necessarily triangular, any non-triangular facets are split into
% triangles. The resulting mesh is both closed and triangular.
%
% [TRI2, N] = cgal_tri_fillholes(TRI, X)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the three
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   Note that this function requires that the triangles in TRI have a
%   manifold orientation. This can be achieved pre-processing with
%
%     [x, tri] = meshcheckrepair(x, tri, 'deep'); % correct orientation
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
%   of a vertex on the surface, indexed by TRI values.
%
%   TRI2 is TRI plus the extra facets that fill the holes.
%
%   N is a scalar with the number of holes that have been filled. N <=
%   number of triangles added to TRI2.
