function varargout = cgal_alpha_shape3(varargin)
% CGAL_ALPHA_SHAPE3  Whole alpha-shape of a 3D set of points
%
% [ALPHALIM, TRI] = cgal_alpha_shape3(X, [], NCOMP)
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of a 3D
%   point.
%
%   NCOMP is a scalar with the number of connected components in the output
%   alpha shape. By default, NCOMP=1.
%
%   ALPHALIM is a 3 vector:
%
%     ALPHALIM(1): minimum in the range of possible alpha values.
%     ALPHALIM(2): optimal alpha value for NCOMP connected  components.
%     ALPHALIM(3): maximum in the range of possible alpha values.
%
%   TRI is a cell containing a 3-column matrix with the alpha-shape
%   triangulation produced by ALPHALIM(2). This alpha-shape has NCOMP
%   connected components. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh. The mesh can be visualised running:
%
%     >> trisurf(tri{1}, x)
%
%
% [~, TRI] = cgal_alpha_shape3(X, ALPHA)
%
%   ALPHA is a vector of scalar alpha values, alpha=R^2, where R is the
%   probe radius. TRI is a cell array of the same length as ALPHA. Cell
%   TRI{i} contains the alpha shape triangulation for ALPHA{i}.
%
% This function uses CGAL's implementation of non-fixed alpha shapes [1].
% With non-fixed alpha shapes, the result for all alpha values is computed
% internally, and then only those the solutions requested by the user are
% extracted. If only an alpha value or a few are required, it may be faster
% to use cgal_fixed_alpha_shape3().
%
% However, note that Matlab function alphavol() implemented by Jonas
% Lundgren and provided as a third-party function in Gerardus seems to be
% faster than either of the CGAL MEX functions, at least for a single alpha
% value.
