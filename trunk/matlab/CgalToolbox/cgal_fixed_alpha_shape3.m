function varargout = cgal_fixed_alpha_shape3(varargin)
% CGAL_FIXED_ALPHA_SHAPE3  Individual alpha-shapes of a 3D set of points
%
% TRI = cgal_fixed_alpha_shape3(X, ALPHA)
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of a 3D
%   point.
%
%   ALPHA is a vector of scalar alpha values, alpha=R^2, where R is the
%   probe radius.
%
%   TRI is a cell array of the same length as ALPHA. Cell TRI{i} contains
%   the alpha shape triangulation for ALPHA{i}. Each row contains the 3
%   nodes that form one triangular facet in the mesh. The i-th mesh can be
%   visualised running:
%
%     >> trisurf(tri{i}, x)
%
%
% This function uses CGAL's implementation of fixed alpha shapes [1]. Fixed
% alpha shapes are more efficient when only the shape for one or a few
% alpha values is required. When many alpha values are required, it may be
% faster to use cgal_alpha_shape3().
%
% However, note that Matlab function alphavol() implemented by Jonas
% Lundgren and provided as a third-party function in Gerardus seems to be
% faster than either of the CGAL MEX functions, at least for a single alpha
% value.
