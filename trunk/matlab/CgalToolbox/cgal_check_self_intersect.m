% CGAL_CHECK_SELF_INTERSECT Check for self-intersections in a triangular
% mesh
%
% This function checks whether each triangle in a mesh intersects any other
% triangle. Finding self-intersections is useful to detect topological
% problems.
%
% C = cgal_check_self_intersect(TRI, X)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   C is a vector with one element per triangle in TRI. It gives a count of
%   the number of times TRI(I,:) causes a self-intersection in the mesh.
%
% C = cgal_check_self_intersect(TRI, X, ITRI)
%
%   ITRI is a row vector of triangle indices. Only the triangles in ITRI
%   will be checked for intersections. Note that C will still be an output
%   vector with length number of triangles in TRI. Intersections for the
%   checked triangles can be obtained as C(ITRI).
%
% This function uses an AABB tree component [1] to efficiently perform the
% intersection queries. However, as the CGAL documentation notes, "this
% component is not suited to the problem of finding all intersecting pairs
% of objects", so there's probably room for improvement.
