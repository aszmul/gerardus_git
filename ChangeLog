	* CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.3):
	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.h
	(v0.2.1):
	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.txx
	(v0.2.1):

	- Suggestion by Bradley Lowekamp to replace my new preprocessor
	macro ITK3 by the standard ITK_VERSION_MAJOR.

	* CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.2):
	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.h
	(v0.2.0):

	(v0.2.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp (v0.3.0):

	- Enable compilation with ITK v4.x.

2012-03-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/test/test_itk_imfilter.m (v0.1.0):

	- Add Script to test the filters provided by itk_imfilter (code
	for the moment only for "advess" filter).

	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkMultiScaleHessianSmoothed3DToVesselnessMeasureImageFilter.txx:
	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.txx:

	- Comment out standard output messages. In Matlab, these are not
	seen until the algorithm finishes, so they don't help to know how
	the algorithm progresses.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.7):

	- Accept .mhd extension for MetaImage format.

	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.txx:

	- Fix bug. Wrong #define label for debug function.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.hpp
	(v0.1.2):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.cpp
	(v0.1.2):

	WSTRENGTH, SENSITIVITY, TIMESTEP, EPSILON.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter (v0.4.5):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.6.4):

	- Add syntax of filter advess to help header.

2012-03-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp (v0.3.2):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.6.3):

	- Reorder methods. Minor edits.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter.m (v0.4.4):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.hpp
	(v0.1.1):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.cpp
	(v0.1.1):

	- Enable user-provided input arguments: sigmaMin, sigmaMax, numSigmaSteps.

	* Add matlab/ItkToolbox/MexAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.hpp
	(v0.1.0):
	* Add matlab/ItkToolbox/MexAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter.cpp
	(v0.1.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter.m (v0.4.3):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.4.3):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.6.2):

	- Add AnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementImageFilter using
	automatic script add_filter_template.sh. It compiles, but of
	course we cannot pass user-provided parameters yet.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/add_filter_template.sh (v0.1.1):

	- Automate adding MexFilter.cpp file to list of source files to
	build itk_imfilter.

	- Automate adding include path for new filter if it's a function
	not in ITK.

	* cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1/itkAnisotropicDiffusionVesselEnhancementFunction.txx
	(v0.1.1):

	- Comment out unused variable declaration to avoid compilation
	warnings.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp (v0.3.1):

	- Comment out the filter instantiations that are not
	OutputTye==InputType, as this is the default.

	* Add matlab/ItkToolbox/add_filter_template.sh (v0.1.0):

	- Script that partly automates adding a new filter to
	itk_imfilter().

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.6.1):

	- Prepare file to allow for script add_filter_template.sh to
	insert code for new filters automatically.

	- Add SELECTFILTER macro to tidy up code.

2012-03-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.4.2):

	- Include IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1 in the build of itk_imfilter().

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.3.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.3.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.hpp (v0.3.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.cpp (v0.2.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.5.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.5.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.hpp (v0.3.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp (v0.3.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.2.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.cpp (v0.2.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.hpp (v0.2.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.cpp (v0.2.0):

	- Important changes to the code:

	- Unify without-parameters and with-parameters constructors as
	with-parameters constructor. Put the declaration in the .hpp
	file. Put the definition in the .cpp file. This simplifies and
	unclutters the code.

	- Now the constructor in charge of checking number of extra input
	parameters, and reading them, instead of
	FilterAdvancedSetup(). Store them to protected member
	variables. Pass then input parameters to filter using
	FilterAdvancedSetup().

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.6.0):

	- Important changes to the code.

	- Without-parameters and with-parameters constructors have been
	unified.

	- Code that decides the output voxel type from the filter and
	input voxel type has been simplified. Now we have special code
	only for filters that don't return the same type as input
	image. The rest are all grouped together.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (0.7.0):
	* matlab/ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (0.2.0):

	- Now the constructor checks that there are at least 2 input
	arguments (filter type and input image).

	- Remove the constructor without user-provided parameters. To
	simplify the code, we are going to use only a general constructor
	always with input parameters (that can be empty for filters that
	don't require them).

	- Add missing types of output voxel: int8, int16, int32.

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.hpp (v0.3.1):

	- Add tests for missing types of output voxel: int8, int16, int32.

2012-03-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add cpp/src/third-party/IJ-Vessel_Enhancement_Diffusion.1:

	- C++ ITK classes that implement the paper

	Enquobahrie A., Ibanez L., Bullitt E., Aylward S., "Vessel
	Enhancing Diffusion Filter", Insight Journal - 2007 MICCAI Open
	Science Workshop.

2012-03-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.6):

	- Stop reading after ElementDataFile, as we assume this is the end
	of the header.

	* release 0.7.0.

	- CMake build system now builds and installs all the command-line
	programs and MEX files in the project. Some had been forgotten,
	after I compiled them by hand from Matlab. But now, everything can
	be compiled from the root CMakeLists.txt.

	- Compilation and build tested for

		Linux 64 bit, gcc 4.6.1, CMake 2.8, ITK 3.20.1,
		Matlab R2011b, Boost 1.46

		Windows 32 bit, Visual Studio 9 (2008), CMake 2.8,
		ITK 3.20.1, Matlab R2008a, Boost 1.47

	* matlab/ThirdPartyToolbox/dijkstra.cpp:

	- Resolve some warnings removing unused variables.

	* matlab/PointsToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.1):

	- Fix bug. In Windows, we need to specify where the Boost include
	directory is.

	* cpp/src/third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.1):

	- Fix bug. In Windows, build fails if INSTALL specifies
	LIBRARY. Removing the word LIBRARY solved the problem.

	- Fix bug. In Windows, we need to specify where the Boost include
	directory is.

	- Fix bug. In Windows, we need to build the static as well as the
	dynamic MBA library. Otherwise, mba_surface_interpolation() cannot
	link to it.

	* CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.1):
	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.2):

	- Hide some warnings given by MSVC compiler.

	- Move search for ITK and Boost to the root directory, so that
	they are available for the cpp and matlab projects.

	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.1):

	- Add subdirectory third-party/mba to the build system.

	* matlab/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.1):

	- Add subdirectories ThirdPartyToolbox and PointsToolbox to the
	build system.

	* Add cpp/src/third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.0):

	- Hide some warnings given by MSVC compiler.

	- This directory was not part of the cmake build system. Now the
	MBA library is built and installed in
	cpp/src/third-party/mba/lib. This library is linked to by the MEX
	function mba_surface_interpolation().

	* Add matlab/PointsToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.0):
	* Add matlab/ThirdPartyToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.1.0):

	- This directory was not part of the cmake build system. I had
	compiled the MEX files

	sparse_breakdown()
	mba_surface_interpolation()
	dijkstra()

	by hand, so I hadn't noticed they were no being compiled until
	now.

	* matlab/PointsToolbox/sparse_breakdown.cpp (v0.1.1):

	- Fix bug. Missing #include.

	* Add programs directory, where compiled command line programs
	will be installed.

	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Add code to install all compiled command line programs into new
	gerardus/programs directory.

	- Fix project name. No good reason why this was called
	GerardusItkToolsProject. Now called GERARDUS_CPP.

	- Instead of relying on having TCLAP installed externally, now we
	distribute it with Gerardus as a third-party library.

	* Add cpp/src/third-party/tclap-1.2.1:

	- TCLAP is the Templatized C++ Command Line Parser Library

	http://tclap.sourceforge.net/

	We use it in C++ programmes to set the syntax of the command and
	read input arguments from the command line.  It's trivial to
	install in Linux, but Windows users have to download, unzip and
	copy it to a local folder.  Then, writing a FindTCLAP.cmake would
	be a bit complicated. As the library doesn't need to be compiled
	(it works as a collection of templated C++ header files), it's
	going to be much simpler to just redistribute the library in
	Gerardus.

2012-03-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Bug spotted by Pablo Lamata: ITK v4.x requires to use
	${ITK_LIBRARIES} instead of e.g. ITKCommon ITKIO when defining
	targets. I have made the change now in advance of moving to ITK
	4.x.

	http://groups.google.com/group/gerardus-users/browse_thread/thread/62aa9fcb67045ae8

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Bug spotted by Pablo Lamata: ITK v4.x requires to use
	${ITK_LIBRARIES} instead of e.g. ITKCommon ITKIO when defining
	targets. I have made the change now in advance of moving to ITK
	4.x.

	http://groups.google.com/group/gerardus-users/browse_thread/thread/62aa9fcb67045ae8

	- No longer build the MEX function deconvolve(). It depends on the
	Clarity library, that depends on the FFTW library. Matlab has its
	own FFTW library, and I haven't found the way yet of preventing
	them to clash with the ones installed outside Matlab.

	* matlab/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Remove SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE RELEASE). That's set in the root
	CMakeLists.txt, not here.

	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt:

	- No longer build the Clarity library, that depends on the FFTW
	library.  Matlab has its own FFTW library, and I haven't found the
	way yet of preventing them to clash with the ones installed
	outside Matlab.

	- We had forgotten to check for two required libraries: Boost and
	TCLAP.  Now we are finding Boost correctly. I have made a temporal
	fix for TCLAP on my computer, by harcoding the path to my TCLAP
	installation, but that path will need to be detected
	automatically.

	- In Windows, we have to link to ${Boost_SYSTEM_LIBRARY}
	${Boost_FILESYSTEM_LIBRARY} instead of boost_system
	boost_filesystem, or else the linker cannot find the libraries.

	- Bug spotted by Pablo Lamata: ITK v4.x requires to use
	${ITK_LIBRARIES} instead of e.g. ITKCommon ITKIO when defining
	targets. I have made the change now in advance of moving to ITK
	4.x.

	http://groups.google.com/group/gerardus-users/browse_thread/thread/62aa9fcb67045ae8

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Multi-configuration systems (e.g. Visual Studio in Windows) are
	different from single configuration systems (e.g. gcc in Linux).
	In the former, we use CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES to tell which
	configurations can be built (Debug; Release for Gerardus), and
	then the configuration is chosen in Visual Studio from a pull-down
	menu.  In the latter, we use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to set the build as
	Release by default.

2012-03-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m (v0.4.0):

	- Seg3D2 does not expect the scirunnrrd struct to have the 4th
	dummy dimension in .mat files, so we no longer create
	it. Currently, it's not possible to run Seg3D 1.x on my linux
	computer, so I couldn't test whether these new .mat format also
	loads in Seg3D 1.x.

2012-03-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add matlab/test/test_smdscale.m (v0.1.0):

	- To test matlab/ManifoldToolbox/smdscale.m.

	* Add matlab/ManifoldToolbox/smdscale.m (v0.1.0):

	- MDSCALE Multidimensional scaling on the surface of a sphere.

	* Add matlab/ManifoldToolbox/gdmatrix.m (v0.1.0):

	- GDMATRIX  Matrix of geodesic distances between points on a
	sphere, in degrees of arc.

	* Add directory for new toolbox, matlab/ManifoldToolbox, for
	functions that operate on Riemannian manifolds, instead of
	Euclidean space.

2012-03-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/PointsToolbox/bwmesh.m (v0.1.4):

	- Fix documentation again. The node index is not the linear index
	of the voxel in the image, but the index of the node in the list
	of nodes.

2012-03-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/PointsToolbox/bwmesh.m (v0.1.3):

	- Fix documentation. Vicente Grau noted that the help header was
	wrong (it corresponded to the old method, that used TriDelaunay
	instead of delaunay).

2012-02-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m (v0.3.2):

	- Fix bug. When writing to .mha file, function
	writemetaimagefile() expects all input arguments in the order x,
	y, z, so not only the image but also the size, spacing and offset
	vectors had to be permuted accordingly.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.5):

	- Fix bug. Size vector shouldn't have permuted the x and y
	components when reading from an .mha file. For consistency, it's
	better to just read the size, spacing and offset values as they
	are in the .mha file (x, y, z), and then permute the whole
	nrrd.axis so that we have rows->y and cols->x.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/writemetaimagefile.m (v0.1.3):

	- Fix bug. The expected input should be having all input arguments
	(image data, spacing, offset, size) in the order x, y, z. And this
	is the order that they have to be written to the .mha file too.

	- Add "logical" (boolean) as input data type.

2012-02-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add matlab/FiltersToolbox/blockproc3.m:

	- BLOCKPROC3 Block processing for a 3D image.

2012-02-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.4):

	- Fix bug. Similarly to yesterday's fixed bug, nrrd.axis.min was
	not being read correctly from .mha files. We had forgotten to
	remove half the voxel size from the offset value.

2012-02-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m (v0.3.1):

	- Fix bug. nrrd.axis.min points to the _corner_ of the first
	voxel, whereas MetaImage's format Offset label referes to the
	_centre_ of the first voxel. Now we are passing the correct offset
	value by adding half the voxel size to nrrd.axis.min.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/writemetaimagefile.m (v0.1.2):

	- Fix bug. Spacing and offset values were saved as a fixed-length
	float with 6 decimal places. But microscopy images often have
	spacing or offsets that can be smaller than that precision, so
	they were being truncated to 0.000000. Now we use an exponential
	format with 12 decimal places (e.g. -2.197265685380e-07), which
	solves that problem.

2012-02-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/typicalpsf.m (v0.2.0):

	- Change input argument thr, so that now they represent quantile
	values. This works better in terms of masking out the background
	of the image.

	- Add input argument minsz, a scalar with the minimum size of a
	bead connected component in voxels. Smaller components will be
	considered noise.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_tiff2nrrd.m (v0.2.4):

	- Don't scale intensity values. This was a very bad idea. A load
	function should not invisibly change intensity values.

2012-02-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m (v0.15.3):

	- If we have no skeleton voxels, don't waste time processing.

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m (v0.4.1):

	- If we have no voxels to prune, don't waste time processing.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_tiff2nrrd.m (v0.2.3):

	- If data was read by microscope as 12-bit, scale intensities so
	that they cover the whole 16-bit range.

2012-01-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_seg3d2matlab.m (v0.1.1):

	- Fix bug. The function crashed if the scinrrd struct didn't
	contain an "axis" field. Now it gives a warning.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (0.2.3):

	- Add many more data types to read from .mha files, to have a
	comprehensive list of MetaImage->Matlab conversion list.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/writemetaimagefile.m (v0.1.1):

	- Add many more data types, to have a comprehensive list of
	Matlab->MetaImage conversion list.

2012-01-27  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.2):

	- Fix bug. All intensity values where converted to single. Now
	nrrd.data has the same type as the data in the file.

2012-01-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.1):

	- Fix bug. When raw data follows header in .mha file, the file
	pointer was not being returned to the right position before
	reading the raw data.

2012-01-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/typicalpsf.m (v0.1.1):

	- Omit bead images that have saturated intensity values when
	estimating the PSF.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m (v0.2.0):

	- Add loading of .lsm files.

2012-01-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m (v0.1.1):
	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/im2metaimage.m (v0.1.1):

	- Use new writemetaimagefile() function to write a single .mha
	function instead of splitting header and image into .mha and .raw
	files.

	* Add matlab/FileFormatToolbox/writemetaimagefile.m (v0.1.0):

	- WRITEMETAIMAGEFILE Write a MetaImage file (.mha) with both
	header and data.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m (v0.3.0):

	- Now nrrd volumes can be saved to MetaImage format as well as
	Matlab format. The reson to do this is that Seg3D at this point
	cannot read the spacing and offset values from an image saved in
	.mat format.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/WriteMhaFile.m (v0.1.1):

	- Tidy up function. Remove unncessary input arguments. Images with
	input type 'char' are not considered valid anymore.

	* matlab/FileFormatToolbox/WriteRawFile.m (v0.2.0):

	- Remove most of the code, that was redundant. What was happening
	is that a header was being written, and then overwritten by the
	raw data. Now only the raw data is written. Also, unnecessary
	input arguments have been removed.

2012-01-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.6.1

	- Added CUDA support with Matlab.

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/Deconvolve.cpp:
	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/deconvolve.m:

	- Edit help header to note that the CUDA implementation is now
	available.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Select gcc v4.4 automatically if we want to compile Clarity with
	its CUDA implementation. The CUDA implementation doesn't seem to
	make a big difference, though. This is a test on a volume with
	size RxCx19 and a PSF of size 9x9x7. Time in seconds.

	 R,C | no CUDA  |  CUDA   |
	---------------------------
	 128 |   14.55  |  15.38  |
	 256 |    9.13  |   9.85  |
	 512 |  103.44  |  93.79  |
	1024 |  162.80  | 156.00  |
	---------------------------

	- Fix bug. We need to tell cmake from here to look in
	cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/CMake, so that it can use
	FindFTTW.cmake.

	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/CMakeLists.txt:

	- If CMAKE_MODULE_PATH has been set from the root CMakeLists.txt
	of Gerardus, do not overwrite it.

	- CUDA v4.0 RC2 is incompatible with gcc >= 4.5. Gcc 4.4. is
	selected in the root gerardus CMakeLists.txt, but this flag needs
	to be set by hand, because otherwise nvcc will read the version of
	the default gcc in the system, that is v4.5.

	* Replace cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity by the latest
	version:

	- Cory Quammen has fixed the bugs in Clarity that prevented it
	from compiling with CUDA enabled at least in Ubuntu 11.10. Version
	downloaded today from

	https://github.com/cquammen/Clarity/downloads

	as cquammen-Clarity-c73c97d.

2011-12-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/RigidRegistration2D.cxx (v0.3.0):

	- Use MattesMutualInformation instead of MeanSquares as the metric.

2011-12-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/RigidRegistration2D.cxx (v0.2.0):

	- Remove backgroundGray argument. Instead, have an "invert"
	switch. If the object is white and the background black, we use
	the normal registration. If viceversa, the user selects
	"--invert", and this inverts the luminance values before
	registration. Also, default background values are automatically
	set depending on "invert" (black, if not selected; white, if
	selected).

2011-12-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/RigidRegistration2D.cxx (v0.1.1):

	- Add input argument to select gray level of background pixels.

	* Add cpp/src/RigidRegistration2D.cxx (v0.1.0):
	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt:
	* cpp/README

	- Program to align one 2D image to another using a rigid
	transformation (rotation and translation).

2011-11-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add matlab/FiltersToolbox/Deconvolve.cpp (v0.1.0):

	- MEX interface to the Clarity deconvolution library. C++
	implementation.

	* Add matlab/FiltersToolbox/deconvolve.m (v0.1.0):

	- MEX interface to the Clarity deconvolution library. Matlab
	helper file.

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Now third-party libraries are installed in gerardus/lib. In
	particular, Clarity is no longer compiled into its source
	directory.

	- Make Clarity a dependency of deconvolve.

	* matlab/CMakeLists.txt, CMakeLists.txt:

	- Move the manual selection of older compilers from
	matlab/CMakeLists.txt to the root CMakeLists.txt. Also note that
	CMAKE_CC_COMPILER is incorrect, the variable is called
	CMAKE_C_COMPILER.

	* Add lib directory to install third-party libraries.

2011-11-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/CMakeLists.txt:

	- We don't need to build the apps and tests of Clarity, comment
	out.

	- Now Clarity will be built in the build tree, instead of the src
	directory, and installed with `make install` to gerardus/lib.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Set CMake install path to gerardus/lib, so that we have
	everything in one place (except for the MEX files, that stay in
	their respective subdirectories).

	- Move the rpath block to this file from matlab/CMakeLists.txt, as
	we need it also to link MEX files to Clarity, and probably for
	future libraries.

	* matlab/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Move the rpath block to CMakeLists.txt, as we need it also to
	link MEX files to Clarity, and probably for future libraries.

	- Upgrade CMake requirement to v2.8.

	- Change CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR so that it
	can be used by the master CMakeLists.txt.

2011-11-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add matlab/FiltersToolbox/typicalpsf.m (v0.1.0):

	- TYPICALPSF Estimate point spread function from microbeads image.

	* matlab/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Update requirement to cmake VERSION 2.8.

	- As it used CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR instead of CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR,
	the MatlabMakeMacros.cmake module could not be found when called
	as a subdirectory of the gerardus root.

	* matlab/FiltersToolbox/imblend.m (v0.2.0):

	- Instead of using only the slope to math intensities in one image
	to another, use the slope and intercept of the linear
	regression. Provide now also the intercept as an output argument.

	* Add CMakeLists.txt:

	- File at the root of gerardus to build everything that can be
	built.

	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Build third-party/cquammen-Clarity as a subproject.

	- Current Matlab (R2011b) no longer requires an older version of
	g++ than what is available in Ubuntu.

	- Several targets now need to be linked explicitely with
	boost_filesystem.

	- Add Rev, Date, native subversion properties.

	* cpp/src/ExtractVoxelCoordinatesFromSegmentationMask.cxx:
	* cpp/src/Skeletonize3DSegmentation.cxx:
	* cpp/src/Vesselness3DImage.cxx:
	* cpp/src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:
	* cpp/src/PadSegmentationMaskWithVoxels.cxx:
	* cpp/src/Resize3DImage.cxx:

	- Add Rev, Date, native subversion properties.

	- Fix bug. Rename deprecated boost library method.

	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/apps/DeconvolveRawImages/DeconvolveRawImages.cxx:
	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/include/internal/Stopwatch.h:
	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/src/FFT.cxx:
	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/src/MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.cxx:
	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/src/Memory.cxx:
	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/src/IDivergenceDeconvolve.cxx:

	- Fix warnings when compiling under linux.

	* cpp/src/third-party/cquammen-Clarity/CMakeLists.txt:

	- We want to have a CMakeLists.txt at the gerardus root, that
	calls every other CMakeLists.txt. Clarity's CMakeLists.txt was
	using policy CMP0003 OLD, which created conflicts between the
	fftw3 libraries in /usr/lib and the one provided by Matlab.

	Also, as it used CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR instead of
	CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, the FindFFTW.cmake module could not be
	found when called as a subdirectory of the gerardus root.

	* Merge all log files (ChangeLog matlab/ChangeLog java/ChangeLog
	cpp/src/ChangeLog shell-script/ChangeLog) into gerardus/ChangeLog.

2011-11-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Rename cquammen-Clarity-v1.0.0-5-c9d0889 to
	cquammen-Clarity. The name was too long.

	* third-party/cquammen-Clarity-v1.0.0-5-c9d0889/WienerDeconvolve.cxx,
	third-party/cquammen-Clarity-v1.0.0-5-c9d0889/src/Clarity.cxx:

	- Fix bug. Missing includes broke the linux build.

	* Add third-party/cquammen-Clarity-v1.0.0-5-c9d0889:

	- Downloaded from https://github.com/cquammen/Clarity.

	"Clarity is an open-source C/C++ library implementing many of the
	common deconvolution algorithms used in fluorescence
	microscopy. It is designed specifically for processing 3D images
	generated from optical sectioning. Clarity uses multithreaded
	algorithms to make full use of all the cores on modern multi-core
	computer systems. For even greater performance, the deconvolution
	algorithms can optionally run on commodity graphics processing
	units that feature hundreds of computing cores. Support for
	acceleration on graphics processing units is currently available
	on NVIDIA graphics cards."

2011-11-01  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/gram2dsq.m (v0.1.1):

	- Replace multiplication by vector of 1s by repmat(), that is
	faster. Add citation to Dattorro 2005.

2011-10-31  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/polardecomp.m (v0.2.0):

	- Swap output arguments so that they follow the natural order of
	the equation.

2011-10-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/dmatrix2coords.m (v0.1.1):

	- Fix bug. Because the resulting vectors from the distance matrix
	can be a rigid transformation of the vectors that created the
	distance matrix in the first place, we can obtain something like
	this from 4 vectors in R^2

	    0.0000   -0.0000    0.4356   -0.1337
            0.0000   -0.0000   -0.1971   -0.4033
            0.0000   -0.0000   -0.0415    0.5437
           -0.0000   -0.0000   -0.1970   -0.0067

	If we now truncate to leave only the two first columns, we are
	throwing away most of the information in the result, and leaving
	only numerical errors. Now, we first sort the columns from largest
	norm to smallest norm, i.e.

           -0.1337    0.4356   -0.0000    0.0000
           -0.4033   -0.1971   -0.0000    0.0000
            0.5437   -0.0415   -0.0000    0.0000
           -0.0067   -0.1970   -0.0000   -0.0000

	before truncating.

	* Add PointsToolbox/gram2dsq.m (v0.1.0):

	- GRAM2DSQ Convert Gram matrix to squared distance matrix.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m (v0.15.1):

	- Fix bug. Take into account that some branches may not have
	voxels associated to them.

	* Add PointsToolbox/polardecomp.m (v0.1.0):

	- POLARDECOMP Polar decomposition of a square complex matrix.

2011-10-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m (v0.15.1):

	- Fix bug. We cannot assume that there are no short leaf
	branches. This function can be called by the pruning
	function. Instead, we now compute the connection matrix, and use
	it to find which branches are leaf-branches. Then, we can convert
	short branches that are also *not* leaves into bifurcation clumps.

	- Convert intermdiate branches with up to 4 voxels to bifurcation
	clumps (before, it was only up to 2).

	- Add commented out code to compute statistic for all
	branches. This will be used to add another constrain to branches
	that are merging.

2011-10-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m (v0.15.0):

	- Add section "convert very short intermediate branches to
	bifurcation clusters". Very short intermediate branches create
	trouble with merging, because they can get in between two branches
	that should actually be neighbours. They also are a pain when
	labelling with region grow the whole segmentation, because they
	will not look like real branches, and they will steal voxels from
	nearby branches. By turning them into bifurcation clumps, we
	overcome these problems.

	- Replace code to create the part of NRRD struct by new function
	scinrrd_im2nrrd(). We actually need a NRRD struct for parts of the
	new code.

	- Add a list of flags to tag bifurcation voxels that should be
	prevented from merging. This will be used when we add the code
	that separates vessels from trabeculations.

	- Add commented out code for "split the skeleton in branches that
	contain both a vessel and a bit of trabeculation". We are saving
	this for the next upgrade of the function.

	- Fix bug. Convert main diagonal of adjacency matrix madj to
	zeros, as it doesn't make sense that a branch is adjacent to
	itself over an arbitrary bifurcation voxel of the many it can have.

2011-10-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m (v0.8.6):

	- Fix bug. Catch exceptions when trying to triangulate with
	delaunay (e.g. when we have fewer than 4 points or they are
	coplanar). Instead of error and exit, make triboundary empty, and
	let the code keep running.

2011-09-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/imblend.m (v0.1.0):

	- Blend two image stacks to increase the apparent dynamic range
	and improve the signal to noise ratio.

2011-09-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_tiff2nrrd.m (v0.2.2):

	- Add support for RGB images in LSM files.

2011-09-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/pts_mesh.m (v0.2.0):

	- Instead of using DelaunayTri, that suffers from a memory leak,
	use delaunay. The function is now much faster too. I have been
	able to process a segmentation from a 574x532x1024 image,
	11,824,529 voxels, in 14 min. Thanks to Kwok Chong from Mathworks
	support, for suggesting how to avoid the memory leak.

2011-09-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_tiff2nrrd.m (v0.2.1):

	- Fix bug. For 3D volumes, stack is an array of structs. We have
	to assume that all frames in stack have the same resolution and
	offset (only values from frame 1 are read).

2011-09-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_tiff2nrrd.m (v0.2.0):

	- Add functionality to read stack obtained from LSM files (the
	struct is different, it has a field "lsm" instead of "info").

2011-09-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ThirdPartyToolbox/TiffreadToolbox/image_background.m:
	* ThirdPartyToolbox/TiffreadToolbox/image_histogram.m:
	* ThirdPartyToolbox/TiffreadToolbox/show_image.m:
	* ThirdPartyToolbox/TiffreadToolbox/show_stack.m:
	* ThirdPartyToolbox/TiffreadToolbox/tiffread.m:

	- Minor edits to the helper headers so that we get a summary in
	README when running update_README.sh.

	* update_README.sh (v0.1.2):

	- Read also toolbox directories within toolbox directory.

	- Remove "./" at the beginning of toolbox name, but don't remove
	any other "/" symbols.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/TiffreadToolbox (v2.7) directory, with files

	image_background.m
	image_histogram.m
	show_image.m
	show_stack.m
	tiffread.m

	Downloaded from

	http://www.cytosim.org/other/

	Licence GPL v3.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_im2nrrd.m (v0.1.0):

	- Correct version number.

	- Add properties svn:eol-style native, svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_tiff2nrrd.m (v0.1.0):

	- Create SCI NRRD struct from TIFF stack.

2011-09-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/bwmesh.m (v0.1.2):

	- Invert order in which nrrdaxis is filled, to avoid reallocating
	memory at every step.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m (v0.8.5):

	- Change output STATS.CylDivergence. Now we give the standard
	deviation of the distance between the each branch surface point,
	and the corresponding point on the surface of the estimated
	cylinder.

	- Fix bug. Make sure that the list of branch voxels is a column
	vector.

2011-09-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.4.0) Removing clumps of bifurcation voxels was wrong,
	because in some cases it disconnected branches. Instead, what we
	are doing now is going to each bifurcation clump, getting the
	neighbouring branches, and keeping only the bifurcation voxels
	required to connected them 2 by 2. For that we are using some code
	copied from skeleton_label().

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.8.4) Fix bug. CylDivergence was being measured for all
	voxels, and not only those on the surface.

	- Move the code to mesh the vessel to new function pts_mesh().

	* PointsToolbox/bwmesh.m (v0.1.1):
	* PointsToolbox/pts_mesh.m (v0.1.1):

	- Only compute triboundary is the user requests it.

	* Add PointsToolbox/bwmesh.m (v0.1.0):

	- Tetrahedral volumetric and triangular surface mesh of a binary
	segmentation.

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_mesh.m (v0.1.0):

	- Tetrahedral volumetric and triangular surface mesh of a cloud of
	points. This is code that was part of scinrrd_seg2label_stats(),
	but as Mikael Wallman was interested, I thought it'd be better to
	have it as an independent function.

2011-09-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (v0.6.2):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.5.2):

	- Move the code in the constructors from the .hpp to the .cpp
	file.

	- Fix memory leak bug. Add destructor to deallocate any memory
	that the Matlab garbage collector won't free automatically. The
	destructor has to be virtual so that derived classes can add their
	own local memory deallocation steps.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.5.2):

	- Fix memory leak bug. After running all methods in the filter
	object, delete the object. This invokes the destructor, that
	deallocates the memory buffers not passed to Matlab. Without this,
	we had a memory leak in the dandist filter, and potentially in any
	other filter that provides more than 1 output.

	- Mummify output buffers before running the filter. This hasn't
	given any problems, but just in case.

	-  Correct help header of syntax 'dandist'.

	* ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter.m:

	- (v0.4.2) Correct help header of syntax 'dandist'.

2011-09-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/labmathmorph.m:

	- (v0.1.0) Mathematical morphology operators on a labelled
	segmentation, one label at a time.

2011-09-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.14.0) Add section "correct labelling of bifurcation
	regions". So far, the segmentation volume around a bifurcation
	area got split between all incident branches. However, it makes
	more sense to maintain the integrity of main branches, and make
	secondary branches start from the wall of the main branch, instead
	of from the skeleton bifurcation.

	To control the amount of correction, there's a new input argument,
	CORRECT. A value of 0.0 means no correction, a value of 1.0 means
	that the main branch expands as much as possible.

2011-09-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.8.3) Fix bug. If the input image had missing labels, the
	branch index was wrong.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.13.2) Use internally a NRRD struct for some operations, as
	this is going to be necessary for the upcoming code to correct
	labelling of bifurcation regions (mostly done, but commented out).

	- Fix bug. 1 voxel branches were considered to be leaf-branches
	always. However, they can be a link between 2 bifurcation
	clumps. Now we have moved the IsLeaf computation to after the
	merging, into its own code block.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.8.2) Fix bug. Sometimes for small branches the points can be
	colinear, in which case it's not possible to compute a 3D
	triangulation. In that case, we skip to the next branch.

2011-09-02  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.8.1) Fix bug. Small branches can end up with no tetrahedra
	in the triangularion, and in that case, we got an error.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.3.1) Fix bug, wrong struct field name.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.13.1) Fix bug. Branches of length 1 voxel are leaf-branches,
	but because their single voxel will never have degree < 2, they
	were not being considered as leaves.

2011-09-01  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.8.0) Add new output STATS.CylDivergence. This is a distance
	estimate between the surface of the actual branch and the
	estimated cylinder. All operations are performed without rounding,
	so the results are better.

	- Remove Dice's Coefficient and Jaccard's
	Index. Converting warped segmentation coordinates to an image
	produces rounding errors. In addition, pixelation (aliasing) is
	substantial for very thin cylinders. Thus, the measures can be
	quite misleading.

2011-08-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.7.4) Fix bug. Dilation and erosion of the segmentation
	turned image must be of only 1 voxel, which is the space available
	at the margins of the image.

2011-08-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m:

	- (v0.2.0) Add input argument CHOP so that we can deactivate the
	conversion of points outside the image to NaN.

2011-08-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.7.3) Computing the degree of each voxel by 3D convolution
	was taking too much memory. Now instead of one 3D convolution, we
	run three 1D convolutions (thanks to linear separability), which
	is faster and doesn't require much memory.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.13.0) Add new input argument, SINGLEMERGE. Now, we can
	decide whether merging at each bifurcation clump will be limited
	to only the 2 branches with the best alignment, or whether any two
	branches with good alignment will be merged.

	The reason is that in the pruning function
	scinrrd_skeleton_prune(), spurious branches can be better aligned
	than the main branch. So SINGLEMERGE=false should be used for
	pruning, and SINGLEMERGE=true should be used to label the
	segmentation after pruning.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.3.1) Remove some unused variables and fix a small bug. When
	a branch had only 1 voxel, the input to a scinrrd_index2world()
	didn't have the expected dimensions.

	- (v0.3.0) Big rewrite of the function. A new step prunes all the
	clumps of voxels. Also, the other two steps (short leaf and
	spurious leaf) are run iteratively until no more branches can be
	pruned. Branches can be merged before pruning.

	- All the code that computed the local radius of a branch for the
	spurious leaf step has been removed (estimation of skeleton
	direction, plane intersection with the volume, etc). Instead, it's
	much faster to just compute the stats for all branches with
	scinrrd_seg2label_stats(), and use the second eigenvalue to
	estimate the major radius of the branch. Instead of comparing it
	to the secondary branch's length, we compare it to the distance
	between the bifurcation and the tip of the leaf, because sometimes
	leaf artifacts are a bit bent and even though they don't protude
	much from the main branch, their length would be large enough to
	prevent pruning.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.7.2) Fix bug. When I removed (br = find(nrrd.data==I)) to
	make the iterations faster for large images, I didn't realize that
	instead of getting all the branch voxels, we were getting only the
	skeleton. Thus, the estimate of branch dimensions was wrong.

	But we couldn't go back to the previous code, because it's just
	too slow. So the solution is that now we find the indices for each
	label before the loop. This uses more memory, but it should be
	fast enough.

	- I have observed that there's a big peak of memory
	consumption with convn(deg, degbox, 'same'). Currently, rat 024
	needs 6 Gb of free RAM to run, even though the volume is only 600M
	or so. Maybe we'll have to go back to computing the voxel degrees
	with the sparse connection matrix.

2011-08-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.7.1) Make cc a mandatory argument. We need it to avoid
	having to do a very expensive search (br = find(nrrd.data==I)) to
	find the voxels in each branch. This was the single most
	computationally expensive step in the function, making each
	iteration take ~1.2 sec for rat 024 (now each iteration takes 0.02
	sec).

	- Add a new input argument STRAIGHT so that the user can decide
	whether branches are straightened or not before computing PCA
	(this used to be done providing cc or not, but now cc is
	mandatory).

	- Use only 5 levels in itk_pstransform('bspline'...), instead of
	6. This makes that step almost 1 order of magnitude faster.

	- Fix some small bugs when the branch had very few voxels and/or
	we could not get 3 valid eigenvalues.

	- (v0.7.0) Instead of using the sparse matrix "d" and vector
	"dict", now we compute the degree of each voxel using a
	convolution. For rat 024 right ventricle, this is 5 times faster
	and uses 70% of the memory.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_crop.m (v0.0.1):

	- Crop an SCI NRRD image or segmentation volume.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.12.0) Full rewrite of the function. The function worked, but
	it was too slow to deal with a full resolution rat heart (). Even
	after removing most of the right ventricle cavity, the
	segmentation presented ~20,000 branches. Times to search for
	branch neighbours ranged in the months. Therefore, it was
	necessary a completely new approach.

	The first improvement is identifying clumps of bifurcation
	voxels. Branches are the remaining voxels, without overlap.

	Instead of using struct CC fields, now we use sparse matrices for
	connections between branches and bifurcation clumps, and amongst
	branches.

	Instead of merging branches in pairs, now we concatenate all
	voxels of all branches to be merged, and let Dijkstra's algorithm
	sort them out.

	Instead of allowing any pair of branches with good alignment
	merge, now only two branches can merge in each bifurcation
	branch. This gives more sensible results, as there should be only
	1 main branch from which secondary branches arise at each
	bifurcation. The method to select which pair is the main branch
	can be improved, maybe taking into account the diameter of the
	vessels.

	Instead of using our own function to label matrices from CC
	structs, now we use Matlab's labelmatrix() function.

	Times to process the whole rat heart are now around 4 or 5 min,
	instead of months.

2011-08-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp (v0.2.4):

	- Fix bug. If TODO was empty, we got a segmentation fault.

2011-08-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.6.0:

	- Big improvement to itk_imfilter().

2011-08-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	- Big improvement to itk_imfilter(). Before, we were creating an
	itk::Image for the input, and copying there the Matlab input
	buffer. Also, copying the filter outputs to Matlab output
	buffers. But now, we graft the Matlab buffers directly into the
	filter, so no copying is necessary. This saves time, and also
	memory, as no duplicates of the input and outputs are performed.

	In the case of some outputs, copying may be necessary. For
	example, if the filter gives an extra output where each voxel is a
	vector. We cannot return that directly, so we need to process that
	output and copy the result to a Matlab buffer.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.5.1):

	- Fix bug. Filter pointer was being passed by value instead of
	reference, so FilterSelector was instantiating the filter class,
	but then the memory address was not being written to the pointer,
	so runFilter() only saw a NULL pointer, that caused a segfault in
	filter->CheckNumberOfOutputs();

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.5.1):

	- Remove some debug messages that I had forgotten.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.5.0):

	- Big rewrite. Before, we instantiate all input/output voxel type
	combinations for each filter, and the specializing with
	EXCLUDEFILTER() to have empty class definitions for those
	combinations that are not supported.

	Now, we only instantiate those filter/input/output combinations
	that are supported. This is a much better approach.

	Now we use an INVALIDINPUTTYPE() macro to give an error when a
	particular filter doesn't support an input voxel type. This is
	something that was missing from the previous release.

	- Create an enum to have a list of supported filters. Then, we can
	pass those values as template parameters. This allows us to
	compile only those filter/input/output combinations that are
	supported. We only need to check the filter string name once with
	ISFILTER(), and after that, just use the enum value.

	- We no longer need an enum OutVoxelType, as an intermediate
	step. That was silly. We can decide on the output voxel type and
	directly pass it to the runFilter() function.

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (v0.6.1):

	- Delete empty constructor, that is no longer necessary as
	EXCLUDEFILTER() has been deleted too.

	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.hpp (v0.2.1):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.7):
	* ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.4.1):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.hpp (v0.2.9):
	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.2.8):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.3):

	- Delete the EXCLUDEFILTER() macro, as it's no longer
	necessary. Now filters are only instantiated with those
	input/output voxel types that they admit.

2011-08-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (v0.6.0):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.5.0):

	- Big reimplementation of BaseFilter. Yesterday, we imported the
	Matlab image buffer directly into the filter, to avoid having to
	copy it to an itk::Image (thus duplicating the memory space and
	wasting time in copying).

	Today, we have done something similar but with the filter
	output. Instead of copying the output of the filter to a Matlab
	buffer, we graft the Matlab buffer as the filter output.

	We have renamed many methods so that they better express what they
	do, and grouped some of the code in methods to make them more
	reusable. From

		void ImportMatlabInputToItkImage();
		virtual void FilterSetup();
		virtual void RunFilter();
		virtual void CopyAllFilterOutputsToMatlab();
		void CopyFilterImageOutputToMatlab();

	we have gone to

		void MallocMatlabOutputBuffer(unsigned int idx);
		void GraftMatlabOutputBufferIntoItkFilterOutput(unsigned int idx);
		virtual void CheckNumberOfOutputs();
		void GraftMatlabInputBufferIntoItkImportFilter();
		void FilterBasicSetup();
		void RunFilter();
		void MummifyFilterOutput(unsigned int idx);
		virtual void ExportOtherFilterOutputsToMatlab();


	* ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.4.0):

	- Part of the code that was used to deal with the second filter output
	now it's part of BaseFilter.

	- Add new methods according to the recoding of BaseFilter.

	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.2.5):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.cpp (v0.1.2):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.cpp (v0.1.6):

	- Rename methods according to the new names in BaseFilter.

	- Filter inputs no longer set in FilterAdvancedSetup().

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.4.5):
	* ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.4.0):
	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.hpp (v0.2.0):
	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp (v0.2.0):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.hpp (v0.2.8):
	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.2.7):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.2):

	- Rename methods according to the new names in BaseFilter.

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.6):

	- Add missing declarations of redefined virtual
	methods. Otherwise, if they are not declared, the BaseFilter
	version of the method is run, instead of the overloaded one.

2011-06-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.5.0:

	- Now itk_imfilter() supports passing parameters to filters. This
	last version hasn't been tested with Windows yet.

2011-08-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.4.1):

	- Add a detailed explanation of how the matrix with the image is
	transposed when passed from Matlab to ITK, and why it doesn't
	matter.

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.1):
	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (0.2.6):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.hpp (v0.2.7):
	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.hpp (v0.1.2):
	* ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.3.5):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.5):

	- Rename CopyMatlabInputToItkImage() as
	ImportMatlabInputToItkImage(), because we no longer copy
	(duplicate) the image data.

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.cpp (v0.1.5):
	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.2.5):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.cpp (v0.1.1):

	- Instead of having a variable "image" in BaseFilter, now we have
	"importFilter->GetOutput()".

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.4.4):

	- Instead of having a variable "image" in BaseFilter, now we have
	"importFilter->GetOutput()".

	- Rename CopyMatlabInputToItkImage() as
	ImportMatlabInputToItkImage(), because we no longer copy
	(duplicate) the image data.

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.4.0):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (v0.5.0):

	- Instead of copying the image data from the C-type array passed
	by Matlab to an itk::Image (hence duplicating the image in
	memory), we now use itk::ImportImageFilter to directly pass the
	array pointer to the ITK filter. This way, there's no need to
	duplicate the image.

	- Instead of having a variable "image" in BaseFilter, now we have
	"importFilter->GetOutput()".

	- Rename CopyMatlabInputToItkImage() as
	ImportMatlabInputToItkImage(), because we no longer copy
	(duplicate) the image data.

	* release 0.5.0:

	- Now itk_imfilter() supports passing parameters to filters. This
	last version hasn't been tested with Windows yet.

	* ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter.m (v0.4.1):

	- Add binary erosion to help header.

2011-08-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* add_itk_imfilter_template.sh (v0.2.1):

	- I had forgotten that for each new filter, an entry in
	CMakeLists.txt has to be added.

	* ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.4.1):
	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.4.3):

	- Added support for filters:

		itkBinaryErodeImageFilter.h

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.4),
	ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.cpp (v0.1.4):

	- Some minor edits to make it more like the corresponding Erode
	files.

	* Add ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/MexBinaryErodeImageFilter.cpp:

	- Copied from MexTemplateFilter.* to add support for
	itkBinaryErodeImageFilter.h to itk_imfilter()

	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp (v0.1.2):

	- Comment out the definitions of the virtual functions, as by
	default their declaration is also commented out in the .hpp file.

	* add_itk_imfilter_template.sh (v0.2.0):

	- Automatically edit the template files created for the new
	filter, ChangeLog and ItkImFilter.cpp, so that the user has a good
	starting point to add support for the new filter. Some #error
	directives have been added at points where the user should look
	and make manual changes before compiling the program.

	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.hpp (v0.1.1):
	* ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp (v0.1.1):

	- Add precompiler errors to force the user look there when he
	tries to compile after automatically adding a new filter with
	add_itk_imfilter_template.sh.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.4.2):

	- Add comments that can be used by script
	add_itk_imfilter_template.sh to recognise where to insert new
	code.

	* update_README.sh (v0.1.1):

	- Add copyright header and set svn properties.

	* Add add_itk_imfilter_template.sh (v0.1.0):

	- Script to automatically create templates and modify
	ItkImFilter.cpp to add a new ITK filter to itk_imfilter(). This
	script only creates the basic skeleton. Specific parameters,
	methods, etc for the filter need to be added by hand.

	- This first version only copies the templates from
	MexTemplateFilter.*, and updates the ChangeLog, but doesn't modify
	the code to tailor it to the new filter.

	* Add ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/MexTemplateFilter.cpp:

	- Template files to help add support for new filters to
	itk_imfilter().

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.4.1):

	- Use shortname and longname of every filter instead of hardcoded
	strings. Add macro ISFILTER() to make the code cleaner.

	- Method CopyMatlabInputsToItkImages() has been renamed as
	CopyMatlabInputToItkImage().

	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (v0.4.2):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.3.8):

	- Rename method CopyMatlabInputsToItkImages() as
	CopyMatlabInputToItkImage(), as there can be only 1 image at the
	input. Also, this method should not be virtual.

	- Add shortname and longname strings. BaseFilter cannot be invoked
	by the user, but the definitions are necessary when we use
	EXCLUDEFILTER().

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.cpp (v0.1.3):
	* ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.3.4):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.cpp (v0.1.4):
	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.2.4):

	- Add shortname and longname strings to every filter, so that we
	don't need to hardcode in ItkImFilter.cpp the string that a user
	can type to invoke a filter.

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.1.3):
	* ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.3.4):
	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.hpp (v0.2.6):
	* ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.2.5):

	- Add shortname and longname strings to every filter, so that we
	don't need to hardcode in ItkImFilter.cpp the string that a user
	can type to invoke a filter.

	- Fix bug. In EXCLUDEFILTER(), wrong method name, and missing method.

2011-08-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.cpp (v0.1.3),
	ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt (v0.4.0),
	ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.3.3),
	ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.cpp (v0.0.2),
	ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.cpp (v0.3.7),
	ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.cpp (v0.2.3),
	ItkToolbox/MexSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.2.4),
	ItkToolbox/MexBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.hpp (v0.2.5),
	ItkToolbox/MexDanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter.hpp (v0.3.3),
	ItkToolbox/MexBinaryDilateImageFilter.hpp (v0.0.2),
	ItkToolbox/MexBaseFilter.hpp (v0.4.1):

	- Rename all filters as Mex*, where * is the full ITK name,
	instead of using a short name that I made up. This way, it'll be
	easier to semi-automate the process of adding new filters.

2011-08-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Add BinaryDilateFilter.cpp to project itk_imfilter().

	* ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.hpp:

	- (v0.3.0) Add functions to test templates from BaseFilter.hpp.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.4.0) Add support for user-provided parameters for
	filters. Number of parameters and list of parameters is kept here,
	and can be accessed by any filter derived class. Also, write a new
	member function getScalarParamValue() to read scalar parameters
	from Matlab (for the moment, only scalar parameters are supported,
	and not vectors of parameters).

	- Move functions to test templates to GerardusCommon.hpp.

	* ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter.m:

	- (v0.4.0) Correct help header to make it easier to write the
	documentation for filters with user-provided parameters.

	- Add syntax for 'bwdilate'.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (v0.4.0):

	- Add support for itk::BinaryDilateImageFilter.

	- Make 2 the minimum number of input arguments, not the exact
	number. This way, the user can provide input parameters for
	specific filters.

	- Fix bug introduced in last revision. We were reading the image
	from argIn[1], which doesn't work if the input data is a NRRD
	struct.

	- Pedantic fix. Use mxLogical instead of bool (although at least
	for linux they are the same type).

	* Add ItkToolbox/BinaryDilateFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/BinaryDilateFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.1.0) Code that is specific to
	itk::BinaryDilateImageFilter. Support for radius and foreground
	value arguments. Structuring element is a ball.

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp (v0.2.2),
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp (v0.2.3),
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp (v0.3.2),
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp (v0.3.2),
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp (v0.3.6), ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp
	(v0.2.4):

	- Pedantic fix. Use mxLogical instead of bool (although at least
	for linux they are the same type).

2011-08-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter.m

	- (v0.3.2) Corrected function declaration syntax, so that when the
	MEX file doesn't exit, it gives the corresponding error instead of
	"Too many output arguments".

2011-08-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.12) Now the Nrrd volume is parse in
	parseInputTypeToTemplate() instead of main(), which makes more
	sense. We no longer pass the filter name as an argument to the
	parsing functions, because now we pass all the input
	arguments. This way we have prepared the field so that we can pass
	the input arguments to the filter parser, and this was pass filter
	parameters.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.5) Fix bug. In ITK, "SetIndex" sets the index coordinates
	of the first voxel of the region, not the real world
	coordinates. In our case, we always want the region to be the
	whole image, so we make it start at (0, 0, 0).

	Also, now we do "SetOrigin" on the image (the real world
	coordinates of the centre of the first voxel), computed from the
	"min" value of the NRRD volume (real world coordinates of the left
	edge of the first voxel).

	* ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp:

	- (v0.2.3) Add comments to make more clear what every function
	returns. Specially that "min" means the left edge of the first
	voxel.

	* ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp:

	- (v0.1.3) Fix bug. The NRRD format considers "min" to be the left
	edge of the first voxel, not the centre. On the other hand, ITK
	considers "origin" to be the centre of the voxel.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp (v0.3.3),
	ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp (v0.2.3),
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp (v0.3.1),
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp (v0.2.2),
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp(v0.2.2):

	- Pass NRRD image by reference in the parse functions and filters
	instead of value, so that it doesn't need to be duplicated. Also,
	protect it from changes by using "const". This, in turn, requires
	that the functions in Nrrd are declared as const, because you
	cannot use a non-const member function on a const object.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.11) Pass NRRD image by reference in the parse functions
	and filters instead of value, so that it doesn't need to be
	duplicated. Also, protect it from changes by using "const".

	- Rename parseFilterToTemplate() as parseFilterTypeAndRun() to
	better reflect what it does.

2011-08-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	 * ItkToolbox/itk_imfilter:

	- (v0.3.1) Update help header.

2011-07-31  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.6.3) Fix bug. We were converting a potentially large
	distance matrix from sparse to full, and this made it run out of
	memory and run very slow.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.2.5) Fix bug. Error when trying to extract length from an
	empty branch parameterisation.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.10) Plot junction point in DEBUG block. Reword paragraph
	of help header.

	- (v0.11.9) Fix bug. Old field names for angle values hadn't been
	removed for branches that are loops.

2011-07-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.6.2) Fix bug. When computing distance from the origin to the
	ellipse, we were solving a linear system (/) instead of dividing
	(./).

	- Make length of box include whole voxels, instead of just from
	centre of first voxel to centre of last voxel.

2011-07-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.6.1) Add input argument P to use a smoothing cubic spline on
	the skeleton before straightening the branch.

	- (v0.6.0) Add measures of vesselness (stats.dice and
	stats.jaccard). It's hard to tell whether a merged branch is a
	vessel or not just from the eigenvalues. For example, parts of the
	cavity can be bumpy, but long and thin. In order to evaluate
	whether a branch looks like a vessel, we compare it to a cylinder
	with the dimensions given by the eigenvalues. If the overlap is
	large, then the cylindrical model is correct and we can say that
	the branch is a vessel.

2011-07-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_im2nrrd.m:

	(v0.0.1) Create SCI NRRD struct from Matlab data.

2011-07-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.5.3) Fix bug. Output stats.islandlocked is given as a double
	instead of a bool.

2011-07-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.8) Fix bug. If two portions of a branch got into
	different buckets, then the buckets could not be merged between
	them.

	Also, repeat the code that searches for neighbours after merging,
	because scinrrd_skeleton_prune() expects fields
	cc2.BranchNeighboursLeft and cc2.BranchNeighboursRight.

	- (v0.11.7) Major rewrite of the function. I have removed many
	unnecessary loops and steps, to make the function faster and
	tidier. The code to compute the angle between two concatenated
	branches has been moved to an individual function. Also, make the
	output consistent so that you get the same struct whether you
	merge branches or not.

2011-07-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.6) Fix bug. cc.BifurcationPixelIdx had inconsistent
	meanings within the function. Now there's a new
	cc.IsolatedBifurcationPixelIdx list that contains all voxels that
	are only surrounded by other bifurcation voxels. These voxels
	don't belong to any branch, but they belong to the skeleton.

	Merge some redundant loops.

2011-07-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.5) Fix bug reported by Pablo Lamata. Branches of length 1
	were being ignored and cc.Degree was not computed for them. Also,
	they were given cc.Length NaN instead of 0, and they were not
	considered leafs. This caused errors in scinrrd_skeleton_prune().

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.2.4) Make 2nd input argument non-mandatory.

	- (v0.2.3) skeleton_label() does no longer produce fields
	cc.BranchNeighbours and cc.BranchLength, so replace their use in
	this function.

2011-07-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.4) Fix bug. When merging, only neighbours on the left
	were taken into account. Now both neighbours on the left and right
	are taken into account.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.2.5) Move CAST2MWSIZE() macro to GeradusCommon.hpp.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.4) Move CAST2MWSIZE() macro to GeradusCommon.hpp.

	* ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.hpp:

	- (v0.2.1) Add CAST2MWSIZE() macro. This header is common for all
	Gerardus' Matlab code, and so it's the right place for it.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.3.2) Fix bug. Pablo Lamata noticed that trying to run the
	filter with 'skel' produced a segfault. I introduced this bug in
	r473, when I removed the constructors definition from
	BaseFilter.cpp, because nothing was done, and put just a {;} in
	the constructor declaration in BaseFilter.hpp. I didn't notice
	that the constructor had an initialization list. As I didn't move
	the initialization list from the definition to the declaration,
	the pointers were not initialized, and when the data was accessed,
	a segfault resulted.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.3) Fix bug. Make sure that list of voxels is a column
	vector, to avoid dimensions error after concatenation.

2011-07-19 Yves <ivmartel@gmail.com>

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp (v0.3.3),
	ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp (v0.2.4):

	- Added the CAST2MWSIZE macro to use the proper data type for
	specific machines (specifically Microsoft Windows 64bits).

2011-07-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.2) In the merging process, first check whether there is
	no neighbour or the alignment is larger than the angle threshold,
	and if so, skip the branch. Otherwise, the branch will be
	processed.

2011-07-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.1) Fix bug. Change the way the merging was performed. It
	was possible for branches to merge forming a "T" shape, depending
	on the values of alpha. For example, branch A is closest to B, so
	they merge. B is closest to C, and they merge, forming a wire. But
	now a secondary branch D is closest to B, and the angle is small
	enough, so it merges forming a "T" shape. With the new method, A
	can only merge with B if B wants to merge with A. Because each
	branch can only merge with 1 branch on each side, this guarantees
	that there are no "T" shapes.

2011-07-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.11.0) Major rewrite of the function, although the
	functionality is roughly the same. The function was not working
	well when it had to merge branches, and the labelling of the whole
	segmentation was not great.

	A problem was dealing with bifurcation voxels and neighbour
	branches. The correspondence between them is complicated. Now,
	each branch is terminated by a bifurcation voxel or a leaf voxel.
	Bifurcation voxels surrounded only by bifurcation voxels are not
	added to any branch, but they are used to find branch neighbours.

	Another problem was that two branches that were continuation of
	each other wouldn't necessarily be merged, depending on how
	neighbours were processed. Now,  "left" and "right" neighbours are
	considered explicitly, and then only the closest ones are merged.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.2.3) Fix bug for Windows 64 bit. Yves Martelli noted a
	compilation error for Windows 64 bit, as mwSize translates to
	size_t, and Visual Studio translates this to "unsigned __int64", a
	non-ASCI type. When it tries to then compile
	itk::FixedArray::operator[](unsigned __int64), it cannot find a
	definition.

	Following Jonathan Cooper's advice, I have added an #ifdef _win64
	block to perform a static cast of the mwSize variables only when
	compiling for Windows 64 bit.

2011-07-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FindMatlab.cmake:

	- (v0.2.2) Extend to Windows 64 bit. Yves Martelli pointed out
	that for Windows 64 bit, Matlab files live in a win64/ instead of
	win32/ directory.

2011-07-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.10.1) Fix bug. Error when sk and im were uint8, but sk had
	only 1 label. The problem occured when the class of sk was decided
	based on the number of objects. But we also need to take into
	account whether we are going to need a TODO label if we have to
	label im.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.5.1) Fix bug. Procrustes alignment was being run with
	Scaling=true, but we need the alignment to be rigid (no scaling),
	so the dimensions of the vessel don't change.

	- (v0.5.1) Replace locally rigid transform by multilevel B-splines
	transform for the non-rigid warp. The B-spline seems to be better
	in that it doesn't introduce any twisting in the vessel.

2011-07-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.2.2) Windows doesn't provide function round(x), so replace
	by floor(x+0.5).

2011-07-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- (v0.3.2) Fix bug pointed out by Pablo Lamata, swap position of x
	and y in linear interpolation.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_local_rigid.m:

	- (v0.1.3) In fact, the 3D straightening constrain seems to limit
	twisting, and no extra 2D rotation is necessary. Now we can also
	use a B-spline warp in Gerardus (itk_pstransform), so we are
	leaving the basic 3D method and we are not going to do further
	work on this function.

	* test/test_itk_pstransform.m:

	- (v0.1.1) Add Test 2, 3D bent vessel.

	* Add ItkToolbox/itk_pstransform.m:

	- Add header help for the mex function, so that it's accessible
	from Matlab.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.2.1) Fix bug. The parameterization cannot be the x
	points. They need to be translated and scaled so that they fit
	within a [0, 1] x [0, 1] x [0, 1] bounding box.

2011-07-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add test/ps-bent-vessel-3d-3.mat, with the coordinates of the
	voxels of a 3D bent vessel segmentation, its skeleton, and a
	parameterization of the skeleton.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.2.0) Add warping with a B-spline, using
	itk::BSplineScatteredDataPointSetToImageFilter.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.10) Remove paragraph from help header about MATLAB_ROOT
	(no longer necessary to set the variables thanks to the modified
	FindMatlab.cmake).

	* ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.1) mxGetPr should only be used for arrays of type double,
	so replace it by mxGetData.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.2) mxGetPr should only be used for arrays of type double,
	so replace it by mxGetData.

2011-07-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.1.1) Add support for 2D points, so that not only 3D points
	are accepted.

	* Add test/nrrd-bent-vessel-3d* files with the segmentation and
	skeleton of 2 bent vessels in 3D.

2011-07-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add test/test_itk_pstransform.m:

	- Script to test itk_pstransform().

	* Delete ItkToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp:

	- Its functionality is now part of ItkPSTransform.cpp.

	* ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Add compilation and installation of itk_pstransform.

	- Remove itk_kernel_transform, that is now part of
	itk_pstransform.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkPSTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.1.0) Basic code to replicate the functionality of
	ItkKernelKernelTransform.cpp, but with the infrastructure to make
	it possible to add the bpline warping method. As an improvement
	over ItkKernelKernelTransform.cpp, now it's possible to give the
	point coordinates as a double or a single in Matlab.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.3.1) Rename FilterType as BaseFilterType so that it's
	clearer and doesn't clash with the derived classes.

	- Empty constructor now goes in the header.

	- Regroup protected members.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.1) Remove constructor's code, as it's empty and can go in
	the header.

2011-07-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp has been deleted.

	* Delete ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.hpp:

	- Move all the code to ItkImFilter.cpp.

	- The parsers are not going to be general functions, but specific
	to the mexFunction() calling them. In addition, it makes the code
	more readable if we have all the pipeline from input argument
	parsing to filter running in the ItkImFilter.cpp file.

	* ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp, ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.hpp:

	- (v0.3.0) Reorder input arguments in the parsers, so that they
	reflect the order in which they are processed: input image, output
	images, filter name.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.9) Paste all the code that used to be in
	ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp.

	- (v0.3.8) Reorder input arguments in ArgumentParsers.hpp.

2011-06-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp:

	- (v0.1.1) Fix bug. It was not checked that data had 3 columns.

2011-06-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/pts_local_rigid.m:

	- (v0.1.2) Although I thought that the 3D rotation constraint
	prevented twisting, it didn't. This new method follows the 3D
	rotation by a 2D rotation around the x-axis to limit a bit the
	twisting, but the results are not great yet.

2011-06-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.4.0

	- Now the MEX ITK functions itk_imfilter(),
	itk_kernel_transform(), and the filter bwregiongrow() compile and
	run under Windows XP 32-bit too. (Built with CMake 2.8 and Visual
	Studio 10).

2011-06-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	- Now the MEX ITK functions itk_imfilter(),
	itk_kernel_transform(), and the filter bwregiongrow() compile and
	run under Windows XP 32-bit too. (Built with CMake 2.8 and Visual
	Studio 10).

	* MatlabMakeMacros.cmake:

	- Don't link to the m library in Windows, as it's not available.

	* ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.2.2) Don't instantiate this filter for bool, because the
	compiler broke in Windows.

	- Silly mistake of using "#import" instead of "#include".

	* ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.1.2) Don't instantiate this filter for bool. For some
	reason, the concept check passed in Linux but not in Windows.

	* ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp:

	- (v0.2.1) Return distances and minimal values as double instead
	of integer.

	* ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp:

	- (v0.1.2) Return distance as a double instead of an integer
	NrrdImage::maxVoxDistance().

	* ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.cpp:

	- (v0.3.1) Correct some type casting that Windows doesn't like.

	- Don't use function div() for integer division, because it's
	incompatible with Windows. Use / (division) and % (reminder)
	instead.

	* ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.hpp, tkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.2.1) Silly mistake of using "#import" instead of "#include".

	* ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp:

	- (v0.2.2) Use log()/log(2.0) instead of log2(), because Windows
	doesn't provide the latter.

	- Silly mistake of using "#import" instead of "#include".

	* FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt, ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- INSTALL() needs different arguments for Windows and
	Linux. Windows DLLs are ARCHIVE, Linux shared objects are LIBRARY.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp:

	- (v0.2.3) Correct some type casting that Windows doesn't like.

	- Don't use function div() for integer division, because it's
	incompatible with Windows. Use / (division) and % (reminder)
	instead.

2011-06-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Add copyright notice.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Matlab 2010b is compatible with g++ 4.5.2, which is the version
	available in the current Ubuntu Natty, so we can comment out the
	lines forcing g++-3.4.

	- With the new FindMatlab.cmake, there's no longer need to
	provided MATLAB_ROOT.

	* FindMatlab.cmake:

	- (v0.2.1) Be more precise with the directory where mex.h is.

	- (v0.2.0) Major rewrite of how the MEX libraries and include
	directory are found in non-Windows systems. Now we are using shell
	commands, e.g. "find". The original FindMatlab.cmake relied on
	some hard-coded paths that have been removed.

	* ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt, FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Conditional to avoid compilation flags that should not be used
	for Windows.

	- Windows requires that ARCHIVE is given as a target for INSTALL
	because it treats static libraries as ARCHIVE.

	* FindMatlab.cmake:

	- Major rewrite of how the MEX libraries are found in Windows.

2011-06-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@cs.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- (v0.3.2) Edit helper header to make clear that gx, gy, gz
	correspond to the coordinates of where the NRRD volume was
	actually sampled to obtain IM. Hence, for INTERP='nn' if you plot
	the plane, it will in general look a bit "jagged" instead of flat.

	- Thanks to Pablo Lamata for pointing out that this feature was
	not clear in the help header.

	* Add FindMatlab.cmake:

	- To make a derivative work of file FindMatlab.cmake released with
	CMake v2.8, because the original seems to be a bit outdated and
	doesn't work with my Windows XP and Visual Studio 10
	install. (Note that the original file does work for Ubuntu Natty)

2011-06-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.5.0) Remove CC.dbif. The Maurer distance is quite misleading
	if the vessel's cross section is very elliptical.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.10.0) Add merging of neighbouring branches that are a
	continuation of each other. The merging is controlled by new input
	arguments alphamax, p.

2011-06-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.4.2) CC.BifurcationPixelIdx has changed from vector to
	vector of cells.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.9.4) Get bifurcation point indices for all types of
	branches, not only leaves.

2011-06-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add subversion property "svn:eol-style native" to all text
	files, so that people working with Windows will get the correct
	end of line characters.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- (v0.3.1) Tidy up code to match Gerardus coding guidelines.

	- (v0.3.0) Patch submitted by Pablo Lamata. Add input argument for
	interpolation type. Before, interpolation was performed by finding
	the nearest voxel to the sampling point (more approrpiate for
	binary segmentations). Now, it's also possible to select linear
	and spline interpolation, which is more appropriate for gray scale
	images.

2011-06-01  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.4.1) Fix bug. The segment cannot be straightened if the
	skeleton doesn't have at least 3 voxels.

2011-05-31  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.2.2) Pruning was not always working great. Before,
	bifurcation voxels were always preserved, and this created
	problems with 1-voxel branches sometimes appearing on the sides of
	main branches. In the last version, bifurcation voxels were always
	removed, and then all non-pruned branches were regenerated in the
	segmentation. But in some cases, this did not regenerate some
	bifurcation voxels, and the skeleton became disconnected. This
	latest revision addresses both problem. Now bifurcation voxels are
	only deleted if they don't disconnect the skeleton.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.9.3) When looking for neighbour branches, skip bifurcation
	voxels that haven't been labelled.

	- (v0.9.2) Fix bug. Wrong number of labels was used to compute the
	data type necessary to contain all labels.

2011-05-27  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.2.1) Fix bug. Wrong variable name.

	- (v0.2.0) Add code to prune spurious branches that are roughly as
	long as the local radius of the main branch they are attached to.

2011-05-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.1.1) We were removing bifurcation voxels unwillingly. Now
	instead of clearing the segmentation and adding the good branches,
	we prunce the very short branches, but keeping the bifurcation
	voxels.

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/skeleton_prune.m as
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_skeleton_prune.m.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/skeleton_prune.m:

	- (v0.1.0) Prune branches in a segmentation's skeletonization.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.9.1) Fix bug. First we need to distribute the bifurcation
	points to their corresponding branches. Then we can loop to find
	connected branches.

2011-05-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.9.0) Add output arguments cc.BranchNeighbours.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- (v0.2.1) Add midx as output argument.

	- (v0.2.0) Complete rewrite. Now we can use any plane to intersect
	the image volume, from horizontal to vertical.

2011-05-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.4.0) Add output arguments stats.nvox and stats.vol.

	- (v0.3.3) For the case when the branch gets straightened, order
	the eigenvalues so that the first one is along the skeleton.

2011-05-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.8.0) Add output argument cc.Degree.

2011-05-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* release v0.4.0

	- Important refactorization of the itk_imfilter architecture, that
	makes maintaining, compiling and extending the code much
	easier. It's also possible to extract more than one output from
	each filter.

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.2.1) Filter types are defined in the base header file, not
	here. Also, to avoid problems in the future, when we refer to a
	FilterType we specify which one,
	e.g. SignedMaurerFilter<InVoxelType,OutVoxelType>::FilterType.

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.3.0) Move code that returns an empty output for empty input
	from the constructor to CopyFilterImageOutputToMatlab(). This is
	the right place for it to be.

	* ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.0) Substantial change. Now filters can output more than
	one image. As a proof of concept, I have modified the
	DanielssonFilter to output not only the distance map, but also an
	array of the same size as the image with the linear index of the
	closest object voxel to each image voxel. This is a reformatting
	of the output provided by
	itk::DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter::GetVectorDistanceMap().

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp, ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp:

	- (v0.2.1) Fix bug. Method had the wrong name.

	* ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Add GerardusCommon.cpp to the itk_imfilter project.

	* ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.hpp, ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.cpp:

	- (v0.3.0) Add ind2sub_itkOffset() so that we can have an
	itk::Offset<3> at the output. Note that it's not possible to
	overload functions on the return value, so the function needs to
	have a different name.

	- (v0.2.0) Add sub2ind() overloaded so that it can take as input
	argument itk::Offset<3>.

	* Add ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/GerardusCommon.cpp:

	- Miscellaneous functions of general use. Functions to convert
	between linear indices and r, c, s indices: sub2ind(), ind2sub().

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.2.0) Big change in architecture. BaseFilter declares the
	filter variable as an ImageToImageFilter, but then it's the
	responsability of each derived filter class to instantiate it in
	its constructor.

	- BaseFilter declares several methods that contain the code to
	load the image, filter it and pass the output to Matlab for a
	plain filter. These methods are virtual, so thanks to polymorphism
	we can override them in the derived filter classes if the filter
	has any special requirements or features.

	- Big thanks to Joe Pitt-Francis, Miguel Bernabeu and Raf Bordas
	for their help and advice that made this architecture change
	possible.

2011-05-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp:

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp, ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.cpp:

	- Move parser functions to new files.

	- Create member functions for BaseFilter to split the filtering in
	different stages. These functions are virtual, so they can be
	redifined by derived classes to introduce functionality specific
	to each fiter.

	- Remove function SetSpecificParameters(), because now its
	functionality will be part of FilterSetup().

	* Add ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp, CMakeLists.txt:

	- Files to contain the functions that parse the input type
	variables to type templates.

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp, SignedMaurerFilter.hpp:

	- Rename member function SetSpecificParameters() as
	SetSpecificFilterParameters().

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp
	(BaseFilter):

	- (v0.1.1) Remove class FilterParamFactory. Now parameters
	specific to each filter are passed through the derived filter
	classes.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- (v0.3.7) New substantial change in the architecture. Now we have
	a BaseFilter class that implements in its constructor the
	filtering of the Matlab image, as before.

	  But now each filter is a class derived from BaseFilter. So if a
	filter has some specific requirements (input arguments, member
	methods or secondary outputs), we can add code just for it.

	  Besides, because we have moved each filter's code to a .cpp and
	.hpp pair of files, we only need to compile the filter we are
	modifying. Previously, every compilation had to recompile all the
	code.

	* Add ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp

	- Files to hold code that is specific to each filter. Each filter
	is a class derived from BaseFilter. There are two blocks of code
	that we need to put in these files:

	  The EXCLUDEFILTER macros in *.hpp/*.cpp make the compiler
	compile the class with an empty constructor and empty methods, so
	that the filter is not instantiated for not allowed input/output
	types.

	  The FILTERINST macros at the end of *.cpp instantiate the filter
	for valid input/output types. This is necessary to avoid errors
	with the linker. The reason is that templated classes either need
	to be completely defined in the header file (which makes the
	compilation slower and possibly the executable larger), or
	instantiated explicitly, as we are doing. This solution was found
	in the following link

	  http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/templates.html#faq-35.15

	* Delete ItkToolbox/FilterExclusions.cpp:

	- This file is no longer needed. Now the filter exclusions are in
	the new files that are specific to each filter.

2011-05-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (0.3.6) Move some code to ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp.

	* CMakeLists.txt, ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Code has been moved from ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp to the new
	files ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp.

	* Add ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp:

	- To contain the BaseFilter class and the auxiliary parsing
	functions that map from type variables to type templates. The
	parsers have to be included here because BaseFilter needs to be
	available for them at compile time. Otherwise, the linker doesn't
	know how to link them together. This is a template problem, as
	pointer out by Raf Bordas. The only solutions, he says, are either
	to put the code together, or to use explicit instantiation of
	every template type, but that's what we are trying to avoid,
	because we can have a large number of combinations. The trade off
	for code simplicity is that compilation will be slower.

	* Rename ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp as
	ItkToolbox/FilterExclusions.hpp.

	* ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- (0.1.1) Pass the number of output arguments from the entry
	mexFunction all the way to the FilterFactory. We are going to need
	it for filters that give more than one output argument.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (0.3.5) Pass the number of output arguments from the entry
	mexFunction all the way to the FilterFactory. We are going to need
	it for filters that give more than one output argument.

	- Rename runTime* functions to parse*, as this describes better
	what they do.

2011-05-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- We are going to pass the pointer to the array of all output
	arguments instead of just the first output argument to the
	FilterFactory.

	* CMakeLists.txt, FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt,
	ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Move the NrrdImage class to ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp.

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- Move the NrrdImage class to ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp.

	- We are going to pass the pointer to the array of all output
	arguments instead of just the first output argument to the
	FilterFactory.

	* Add ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp, ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp:

	- Create these two files to remove the NrrdImage class from
	ItkImFilter.cpp.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.7.2) Fix bug. Remove small patch of voxels only of we are
	labelling the image.

2011-05-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* All *.m, *.cpp, *.hpp files:

	- Add missing help headers, authour, version, $Rev$ and $Date$, if
	necessary.

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.7.1) In some very particular cases, a small patch of voxels
	may be left unlabelled. We are just going to remove them from the
	segmentation

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.3.2) Fix bugs. Avoid trying to straighten branches with 1 or
	2 voxels. Deal with the case when the branch produces less than 3
	eigenvalues.

	- Add svn:keywords Date.

	- Maurer distances inside the object are negative by default, so
	we have to convert them to the positive value.

	- Add svn:keywords Rev.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (FilterParamFactory):

	- (v0.3.4) Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	- Make Maurer filter give the output in actual Euclidean
	distances, not squared ones.

2011-05-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

 	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.7.0) Add output field cc.BifurcationPixelIdx.

2011-05-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- (v0.1.0) Add exclusions for SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- Add SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter to compute signed
	distances in real world coordinates.

	- (v0.3.3) Thanks to a new FilterParamFactory class with explicit
	specialization, we can treat each filter type differently in terms
	of parameters. So e.g. we can run filter->SetAlpha1(0.3) for a
	certain filter type, but don't do it for the rest.

	- (v0.3.2) Move template explicit specialization code to
	ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp, add comments so that the
	code can be well understood and tidy up.

	* Add ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	-  This is a file to remove some cluttering from file
	ItkImFilter.cpp. It contains the template explicit specialization
	code that prevents the compiler from trying to instantiate certain
	input/output image types for certain filters.

2011-05-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.1) Very big internal change in architecture, that doesn't
	change the interface. Now, instead of nesting switch and if
	clauses in mexFunction() to instantiate the different combinations
	of input/output image type, we have created functions that allow
	us to translate from the type variables to type templates. Now we
	can run all filters with one FilterFactory, because types not
	supported by each filter can be explicitely removed from the
	compilation. These changes came after a lengthly discussion with
	Miguel Bernabeu who figured out the problem I had to solve.

	- (v0.3.0) Accept SCI NRRD structs created by scinrrd_load() as
	input, so that we can pass image resolution and offset to the
	filter. This has been a substantial rewrite, because we had to
	create an NrrdImage class to parse the NRRD fields and pass them
	to runFilter().

2011-05-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m:

	- (v0.1.0) Add version number and note on help header to make
	clear that nrrd.axis(1) corresponds to rows, not to the
	x-coordinate.

2011-05-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.2.0) Add DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter. This basically
	meant creating another runFilter() for the case where the input
	and output images don't have the same type, and some template
	tricks to e.g. be able to test the output image type using the
	templated type. Now it should be very easy to add new filters that
	produce an result with a different type than the input image.

2011-05-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.3.1) Don't try to straighten branches that cannot be
	parameterized (at the moment, the only case I can think of are
	branches with loops).

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.6.1) We no longer split up loops, because it doesn't really
	make sense to try to parameterize a loop as a 1-D spline.

2011-05-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.6.0) Add field cc.IsLoop to output.

	- Fix bug. For branches that were a loop not connected to any
	other part of the skeleton, there were no extreme points and this
	gave an error when trying to index an empty array.

2011-05-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.5.0) Add fields cc.IsLeaf, cc..BranchLength to output.

	- (v0.4.2) Fix bug. When adding bifurcation points to branches, in
	some cases voxels could get duplicated.

	- (v0.4.1) Fix bug. Branches forming a loop were not correctly
	parameterized. We were choosing an extreme voxel, and then finding
	the furtherst voxel. In a "linear" branch this works fine, but in
	a loop, the furthest voxel is at the other end of the loop, so
	half the loop was being dropped. Now, we break loops open before
	computing Dijkstra, so all the voxels are included.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp (MexFunction, getNeighbours):
	v0.2.2

	- Fix bug. As the neighbour r, c, s indices we are using a
	mwIndex, that is a long unsigned int. So when we were doing
	rcs[2]-1 and rcs[2]==0, instead of getting -1, the number wrapped
	around due to an implicit cast and gave 18446744073709551615.

	- Fix bug. If res was not provided, we were passing a NULL pointer
	to run(), that gave a segfault.

2011-05-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m: v0.3.0

	- SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS Shape stats for each object in a
	multi-label segmentation; objects can be straightened with an
	skeleton or medial line before computing the stats.

	* Delete FiltersToolbox/landlocked_stats.m:

	- Move its functionality to
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m to avoid having different
	functions that do similar things.

2011-05-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_squeeze.m: v0.1.2

	- Don't remove dimension from nrrd.axis if it's not a dummy
	dimension.

2011-04-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.4.0

	- Replace slow Dijkstra-based labelling of the whole image by new
	very fast region grow algorithm bwregiongrow().

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.m: v0.2.0

	- Remove all Matlab code, that was very slow and inefficient. This
	function is now fully implemented in C++ in the corresponding MEX
	function, that is very fast.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp: v0.2.1

	- Add input argument maxiter, to limit the number of grow
	iterations of the algorithm.

	* FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Rename FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp as
	FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp.

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp as
	FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp: v0.2.0

	- Complete rewrite of the function. Now instead of implementing
	only a loop of the Matlab function, it implements the whole region
	grow algorithm. We don't need to use a distance matrix, and the
	algorithm is super fast (6 sec with the right.mha image that
	would've probably taken over 35 min with the Dijkstra Matlab
	method, and a lot more with the region grow implemented in Matlab).

2011-04-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.m:

	- BWREGIONGROW  Region grow segmentation of binary image from
	multiple seeds.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp: v0.1.0

	- This is an auxiliary function to bwregiongrow.m, to implement
	part of the algorithm in C++ so that we can avoid a costly loop in
	Matlab.

2011-04-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- Change a type that was int to mwSize, so that it can be compiled
	for 64 bit architectures.

	* matlab/MatlabMakeMacros.cmake:

	- In 64 bit architectures, we need to remove the flag
	-DMX_COMPAT_32 (this is what mex -largeArrayDims does).

	* FiltersToolbox/seg2dmat.m: v0.2.1

	- We were removing voxels not connected to other voxels from the
	dictionary and the distance matrix. This creates all sorts of
	problems with other functions, because when they find an isolated
	voxel, they try to index a non-existent entry in dict or the
	distance matrix.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.m: v0.1.0

	- BWREGIONGROW  Region grow segmentation of binary image from
	multiple seeds.

2011-04-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.3.3

	- Use new slow mode in graph_nn() to avoid running out of
	memory. Either method is, however, too slow, with a expected 35
	min to partition a 468x159x475 image with only 16510 skeleton
	voxels.

	* PointToolbox/graph_nn.m: v0.2.0

	- Add new input argument FAST, to choose between running it in
	vectorized mode (faster), or using a loop (less memory).

	- Fix bug. Voxels not connected to the skeleton (min distance =
	Inf) were being assigned skeleton index 1. Now they get NaN.

	- Remove predecessors list, we don't need it, and it needs a lot
	of memory.

2011-04-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Delete matlab/test/bent-vessel-2d.mat

	- Not an image, just some vectors and matrices that are difficult
	to use.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m: v0.2.0

	- Fix bug. Skeleton voxels that are not part of the branch voxels
	need to be added to the branch. This can happen because a labelled
	segmentation voxel can belong only to one object, but a skeleton
	bifurcation voxel can be actually shared by more than one.

	- Big rewrite, tidy up, and remove all the code about
	straightening, that is now under function pts_local_rigid().

	- Remove STRAIGHT input argument, that is now implicit if CC is
	provided.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_local_rigid.m: v0.1.1

	- Fix bug. The rotation and translation was wrong, and it became
	apparent when running the function on the 3D example
	bent-vessel-3d-2.mat. Now the points are correctly translated
	before and after rotation, and the procrustes registration is
	unnecessary within the loop.

2011-04-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.3

	- After releasing first versions of functions in matlab/ItkToolbox
	that allow to run ITK code from Matlab.

	* update_README.sh:

	- Avod recursing into directories. This avoids that it finds the
	*Toolbox directories in bin/

	* Move itk functions to new ItkToolbox directory

	- FiltersToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp
	- FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt
	- FiltersToolbox/itk_imfilter.m
	- PointsToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp
	- PointsToolbox/CMakeLists.txt
	- PointsToolbox/itk_kernel_transform.m
	- CMakeLists.txt

	* Add new directory ItkToolbox

	* Add FiltersToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp,
	FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt, FiltersToolbox/itk_imfilter.m:

	- ITK_IMFILTER: Run ITK filter on a 2D or 3D image.

	- This is also a big development in the project, because even
	though this function currently implements only the skeleton
	filter, it is templated so that it can use many of Matlab's matrix
	classes (double, boolean, uint8, etc), and it's generic enough
	that adding new filters should be easy.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Build new function itk_imfilter().

2011-04-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add some test data to matlab/test

	- bent-vessel-2d.mat
	- veins-tree-blob.mat
	- veins-tree-blob.mha
	- veins-tree-blob-skeleton.mat
	- veins-tree-blob-skeleton.mha

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_local_rigid.m: v0.1.0

	- PTS_LOCAL_RIGID Non-rigid transformation that is locally rigid
	between two sets of points with known correspondence.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m: v0.2.1

	- Add default for CHOP input argument.

2011-04-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/landlocked_stats.m: v0.1.0

	- LANDLOCKED_STATS Assess whether sections of voxels are
	surrounded by other sections (land) or by background (water).

	* Add PointsToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp,
	PointsToolbox/itk_kernel_transform.m: v0.1.0

	- ITK_KERNEL_TRANSFORM ITK warps between 3D point sets with a
	known correspondence.

	* Add CMakeLists.txt, PointsToolbox/CMakeLists.txt,
	MatlabMakeMacros.cmake:

	- Cmake files to build PointsToolbox/itk_kernel_transform.mexa64.

	- This is a big development for the project, because now we know
	how to write C++ code with ITK functions, and compile it as a MEX
	file so that we can run it directly from Matlab. Also, we can
	build the files using cmake, and we don't need mex.

2011-04-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_plot.m: v0.2.0

	- Add input arguments varargin so that we can pass extra options
	to the plots.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m: v0.2.0

	- Add input argument CHOP so that we can deactivate the conversion
	of points outside the image to NaN.

2011-04-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m: v0.1.0

	- SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS  Shape stats for each label in a
	multi-label segmentation.

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2vesselness.m as
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2voxel_stats.m.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_rotmat.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_ROTMAT Compute rotation matrix to minimize least squares
	error.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_procrustes.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_PROCRUSTES Least-Squares Fit Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis
	between two sets of points.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_procrustes_gen.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_PROCRUSTES_GEN Generalized Least-Squares Fit Orthogonal
	Procrustes Analysis.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_cn.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_CN Center and normalize a set of points.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_simil_map.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_SIMIL_MAP Apply similarity transformation to points.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_simil_map_params.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_SIMIL_MAP_PARAMS Compute similarity transformation
	parameters between sets of points with unknown
	correspondence (Procrustes is used).

2011-04-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/pts_pca.m: v1.1.0

	- Don't chop off small eigenvalues. First, because depending on
	the scaling of the data, a small eigenvalue may actually be
	significant. Second, because small or negative eigenvalues may
	indicate interesting features in the data. Third, because it's
	easy to remove them afterwards if they are creating numerical
	errors in some application.

	* PointsToolbox/coords_from_dist_gower.m: v0.2.0

	- Add collinearity test.

	* Add PointsToolbox/iscollinear.m: v0.1.0

	- ISCOLLINEAR Test to determine whether a set of points are
	collinear.

2011-04-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/dmatrix_complete: v0.1.0

	- DMATRIX_COMPLETE Fill in empty elements of non-Euclidean
	distance matrix.

	* PointsToolbox/dmatrix2coords.m: v0.1.0

	- DMATRIX2COORDS Point coordinates from distance matrix.

	* PointsToolbox/plot_dmatrix.m: v0.1.1

	- Plot vertices as disconnected dots, so that their connections
	don't get confused with distance matrix connetions.

2011-04-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.3.2

	- Add PixelParam field to CC output, with the parameterization
	value for each branch voxel computed as the accumulated chord
	distance between consecutive voxels.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/skeleton_plot.m: v0.1.0

	- SKELETON_PLOT Plot a labelled segmentation and its skeleton.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.3.1

	- Add as output arguments skeleton distance matrix, and
	dictionaries to convert between image and distance matrix indices.

	- Now voxels in each branch are sorted, so that we can walk from
	one termination point to the other without "jumps".

2011-04-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.2.2

	- Add bifurcation points to every branch they terminate. This way,
	it will be easier to sort the points in the branch, as we will
	have 2 termination points (leaf/bifurcation or
	bifurcation/bifurcation) in every branch.

2011-04-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.2.1

	- Fix bug. Instead of adding the bifurcation voxel, we were adding
	its neighbour.

	- Add input arguments so that besides the skeleton, we can pass
	the original segmentation. Now, the whole segmentation and not
	only the skeleton will get labelled.

	* Add matlab/test/veins-tree.mat, matlab/test/veins-tree.mha:

	- To test the new functionality in skeleton_label().

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_squeeze.m: v0.1.1

	- Fix bug. Remove dummy dimension also when nrrd.data has only 3
	dimensions. If you have a single slice, Seg3D saves it with a
	3-dimensional matrix (with a first dummy dimension), but 4
	elements for the nrrd.axis. So this function was working wrong for
	1-slice volumes.

	* Add PointToolbox/graph_nn.m: v0.1.0

	- GRAPH_NN Nearest neighbours from a subset of nodes in a graph to
	another subset.

2011-04-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add test/veins-tree-skeleton.mat, test/veins-tree-skeleton.mha:

	- A 2D segmentation that looks like a tree of veins (with a
	cycle), to test skeleton_label().

	* Add test directory.

	- Directory to keep data and scripts for tests.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.1.0

	- SKELETON_LABEL Give each branch of a skeleton a different label.

2011-04-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/seg2dmat.m: v0.2.0

	- Add input variable for voxel size different from [1 1 1].

	- Add input flag to create a smaller output matrix, but indexing
	only the segmented voxels of the image, not all the voxels in the
	image.

	* Rename img_adjacency_distance.m as im2imat.m.

	* Rename img_adjacency_distance.cpp as im2imat.cpp.

	* FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.m: v0.1.1

	- Small rewrite of help header to make it more consistent with new
	function seg2dmat.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/seg2dmat.m: v0.1.0

	- SEG2DMAT Local neighbourhood distance matrix between
	segmentation voxels.

2011-04-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2vesselness.m: v0.1.0

	- SCINRRD_SEG2VESSELNESS Vesselness parameters from a segmentation
	mask.

	* PointsToolbox/plotaxes.m: v0.2.0

	- Add varargin to be able to pass extra arguments to the plot
	function.

2011-04-01  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add Vesselness3DImage.cxx: v0.1

	- Program to compute the vesselness measure for each voxel of a 3D
	image. Vesselness is a measure of how much does the voxel look
	like belonging to a long cilindrical structure, as opposed to,
	e.g. a blob or a plate.

2011-03-31  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add Skeletonize3DSegmentation.cxx:

	- Program to reduce a segmentation to its skeleton.

2011-03-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add src/third-party/itkBinaryThinningImageFilter3D

	- Code from H Homann, "Implementation of a 3D thinning algorithm",
	The Insight Journal, Jul 2007.

	http://hdl.handle.net/1926/1292

	* ExtractVoxelCoordinatesFromSegmentationMask.cxx,
	PadSegmentationMaskWithVoxels.cxx, Resize3DImage.cxx: Add author.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add comment licence headers.

	* Resize3DImage.cxx: Add comment and licence headers.

	* Delete MbaSurfaceInterpolation.cxx: Test code no longer needed.

2011-03-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable so that the code
	is optimized for speed.

2011-03-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/surface_interpolation.m: v0.1.2

	- Add 'mbae' interpolation: Like the 'mba' method, but first a
	thin-plate spline is used to extrapolate values on the
	interpolation domain boundary. Then MBA is used for the local
	support interpolation of X and the boundary values set by the
	thin-plate spline.

2011-03-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_surface_interpolation.m:

	- Remove the surface interpolation code to create new function
	CardiacToolbox/surface_interpolation.m.

	* Add CardiacToolbox/surface_interpolation.m:

	- SURFACE_INTERPOLATION Interpolate a surface from a scattered set
	of points.

	- Create this fuction from part of the code in
	CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_surface_interpolation.m. It didn't make
	sense to have all that code depending on using SCI volumes.

	* Rename CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m as
	PointsToolbox/scinrrd_surface_interpolation.

	- As this is a function for general surface interpolation, it
	doesn't make much sense to give it such an specific name as
	"vale_surface".

	* README

	- First time the README file is automatically generated by
	update_README.sh. From now on, we will not point the updates in
	the ChangeLog, but they will be part of changes to the toolboxes.

	* Add update_README.sh:

	- Script to automatically extract the summary of the help headers
	of all the Matlab functions in this toolbox, and generate a README
	file.

2011-03-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Now libMBA.so is installed in matlab/PointsToolbox, so that it's
	in the same directory as the MEX function that makes use of it.

	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Force the gcc and g++ compilers version to be 4.3. This is the
	version that Matlab currently requires, and we have to compile the
	libMBA library with the same version as the MEX file in the matlab
	directory.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m: v0.2

	- Add input argument v73, a flag to save to v7.3 format, so that
	we can save volumes larger than 2GB.

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m: v0.3

	- Add new otions to header file.

	- Add 'mba' interpolation, that makes use of the new MEX-file
	mba_surface_interpolation.cpp to provide Multilevel B-Spline
	Approximation interpolation.

	-Use 'natural' option for TriScatteredInterp(), so that the
	interpolant is smoother.

	* Add matlab/PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation.cpp,
	matlab/PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation.m:

	- MBA_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION Scattered data Multilevel B-spline
	interpolation.

2011-03-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* third-party/mba/include/UCButils.h,
	third-party/mba/src/UCButils.cpp:

	- Add UCBspl::printCSVgrid() method so that I can output the
	interpolated grid points to a CSV file that Matlab can read.

	* third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Remove dependencies to OpenGL, that were giving linking problems
	and don't seem to be necessary for mbaSurfaceInterpolation to run. 

	* Add MbaSurfaceInterpolation.cxx:

	- So far, I copied the example provided by the original MBA
	developers, and made some changes for a quick and dirty test of
	the interpolation code. It throws a segmentation fault if you try
	to interpolate outside the square that contains the grid.

	* Add engopts.sh:

	- Matlab's configuration file modified so that we can compile and
	link PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation doing

	>> mex -v -largeArrayDims -outdir PointsToolbox/ -f ./engopts.sh PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation.cpp

2011-03-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Rename third-party/mba/Makefile provided by original developers as
	third-party/mba/Makefile.orginal so that it doesn't interfere with
	files generated by cmake.

	* Add third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt

	- So that we can use cmake to build the MBA library and integrate
	it with Gerardus, instead of the Makefile provided by the orginal
	developers.

	* Add third-party/mba

	- Directory with the MBA library (SINTEF Multilevel B-spline
	Approximation library - version 1.1), Copyright (C) 2000-2005
	SINTEF ICT, Applied Mathematics, Norway. GPL.

2011-03-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m: v0.2

	- Add 'gridfit' option to interpolate (actually, approximate)
	using John D'Errico's gridfit() function.

	- Add 'tsi' option to interpolate using Matlab's
	TriScatteredInterp() function.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/gridfit.m: v2.0

	- By John D'Errico

	- estimates a surface on a 2d grid, based on scattered data
	Replicates are allowed. All methods extrapolate to the grid
	boundaries. Gridfit uses a modified ridge estimator to generate
	the surface, where the bias is toward smoothness.

        Gridfit is not an interpolant. Its goal is a smooth surface that
	approximates your data, but allows you to control the amount of
	smoothing.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/L2_distance.m

	- L2_DISTANCE - computes Euclidean distance matrix

	- By Roland Bunschoten

	- Requirement of the isomap functions.

2011-03-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/Isomap.m, ThirdPartyToolbox/IsomapII.m

	- Add modified code from Josh Tenenbaum, to compute Isomap
	embedding using an advanced version of the algorithm in Tenenbaum,
	de Silva, and Langford (2000), which can take advantage of
	sparsity in the graph and redundancy in the distances.

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m: v0.1

	- Add Isomap function to compute interpolation domain.

	- Rewrite the function to be able to use different methods to
	compute the interpolation domain, use different interpolants and
	the factor for the interpolation domain size.

	- Correct the way the interpolation is computed for the PCA
	method. I was rotating the horizontal domain, interpolation and
	rotating back, but this is incorrect because it does not give you
	the same point.

2011-03-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/dmatrix.m: v3.0

	- Fix copyright notice to be uniform with the rest of Gerardus.

	- Add input argument METHOD to select other distances than
	Euclidean.

	* Add PointsToolbox/plot_dmatrix.m

	- PLOT_DMATRIX Plot the connections implied by a distance matrix.

2011-02-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m

	- Rename the input argument nrrd to scirunnrrd so that we don't
	need to duplicate the memory.

	- Add output argument nrrd to give the reformatted data volume
	actually saved.

	- Undo last change. The flag -v7.3 is not necessary, and prevents
	Seg3D from loading the segmentations. I think the problem was that
	if Matlab runs out of memory while trying to save the NRRD volume,
	it gives the flag -v7.3 error.

2011-02-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

 	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m

	- Force saving with flag -v7.3 to avoid warning message.

2011-02-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- Add input argument so that the user can give the Gaussian
	standard deviation in voxel units.

2011-02-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- Add input arguments to override the automatically computed
	standard deviations for the Gaussian low-pass filtering. This way,
	it's possible to blur more or less. If the std=0, the Gaussian
	filtering is skipped for that coordinate.

2011-02-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* cpp/src/CMakeLists.txt

	- Add boost_system to the list of libraries each program has to be
	linked too. I have no idea why linking has been working in the
	past without this.

2011-02-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/pts_tps_map.m v6.4

	- Remove whitespace before or after bracket.

	- Fix bug. A bad testing condition prevented the computation of
	interpolated points apart from the first one in the SLOW mode.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Add input argument to switch between fast (and more memory
	consuming) and slow thin-plate spline interpolation.

	- Fix bug, force scaling factor to be a 3-vector so that it can be
	different in each coordinate.

	- Clear memory as it's no longer needed, so that we can process
	bigger images.

	- Add sigma as output argument so that we now how many voxels we
	are using to low-pass filter the image.

2011-02-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* README

	- Add entry for img_tps_map

2011-02-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* README

	- Add some function names and descriptions that I had forgotten.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/img_tps_map.m

	- IMG_TPS_MAP Warp an image using a thin-plate spline
	transformation

2011-02-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Now the standard deviation necessary to prevent aliasing is
	computed based on proper formulas, instead of guessing. Notes
	about the computations have been added to the help header.

	- Add input argument sigma to force bandwidth of Gaussian filter.

	- Fix bug, the number of rows and columns were swapped, so that
	after reshaping the interpolated intensity vector, the voxels were
	in the wrong place.

2011-01-31  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_tps_weights.m from svn://edison.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ramc/rcasero/matlab-toolbox/pts/trunk/pts_tps_weights.m

	PTS_TPS_WEIGHTS  Compute weights and affine parameters of
	thin-plate spline warp for N-dimensional points

	This function is a dependency that I had forgotten for
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m.

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_tps_map.m from
	svn://edison.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ramc/rcasero/matlab-toolbox/pts/trunk/pts_tps_map.m

	PTS_TPS_MAP Interpolate/warp/map N-dimensional points using a
	thin-plate spline transformation

	This function is a dependency that I had forgotten for
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Make function a lot faster, especially with large images.

	Instead of low-pass filtering the image, reducing the size and
	sampling the background points, now we sample the background
	points and a region around them, and low-pass filter only the
	voxels of interest.

2011-01-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Add low-pass anti-aliasing filter before downsampling
	image. Make it optative, in case filtering is too slow.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/fspecial3.m

	- FSPECIAL3  Create predefined 3-dimensional filters.

2011-01-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Add input argument to select prescaling. Because using the TPS
	to interpolate all voxels can be rather slow, and the bias field
	is anyway a slow varying field, it's convenient to first quickly
	reduce the image size by A (using bilinear interpolation),
	interpolate the bias field in the smaller image with the TPS, and
	then expand to the original size. By default, A = 1.0 and no
	rescaling is used.

2011-01-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD  Estimate MRI bias field.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m

	- The way indices and coordinates were computed was wrong. Offset
	gives the coordinates of the first voxel's vertex, not the voxel's
	centre. Now integer indices correspond to the voxels' centres.

2010-12-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m

	- Roll back last change, it was not a bug. Rewrite help header to
	clarify the coordinate and index order.

2010-12-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m

	- Fix bug. The x,y coordinates (and, correspondingly, the j, i
	indices) were being operated with the wrong spacing and limit
	values. For example, the x-coordinate was being operated with the
	dy spacing. Now this has been fixed.

2010-10-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- After asking in the ITK user mailing list, Dan Mueller suggested
	using IdentityTransform. I started looking, and found that there's
	actually an example on how to decimate in ITK, in
	Examples/Filtering/SubsampleVolume.cxx. I adapted the code, and
	figured out how to scale the sigma value of the low-pass filter to
	get a similar result to the Resample tool in Seg3D.

2010-07-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- Start adding program to resize an image volume, trying an
	approach of ScaleTransform to resize the image. This is not
	working very well, because there's no Gaussian filtering, and the
	coordinate frame is changed. I'm going to switch to using
	MultiResolutionPyramidImageFilter, but before I'm commiting the
	code in case I need to roll back.

2010-07-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m

	- Give error if the data is compressed.

	- If ElementDatafile is LOCAL, then raw data is in the file, not
	an external one.

2010-07-01  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m

	- Add input argument to control whether data is converted to uint8
	or not before saving.

	* CardiacToolbox/process_misas_patient.m

	- if we have two NormalMri volumes, combine them with a max()
	function to remove banding artifacts, as suggested by Matt Robson

2010-06-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.2.1

	- New minor release given that the bug in WriteRawFile.m and
	WriteMhaFile.m was quite severe, and the new scinrrd_load()
	functionality is interesting.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m

	- Now this function can also load an nrrd struct from MetaImage
	(.mha) files, and not only Matlab (.mat). This should save us from
	a lot of time wasted having to load .mha files in Seg3D and
	exported as .mat.

2010-06-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/WriteRawFile.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/WriteMhaFile.m

	- Fix bug. DICOM frames are loaded into Matlab with X-coordinates
	along columns, but they were written along rows, so the image
	volume was rotated 90º.

2010-06-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.2

	- After submission of paper to MICCAI STACOM 2010: R. Casero,
	R.A.B. Burton, T.A. Quinn, C. Bollensdorff, P. Hales,
	J.E. Schneider, P. Kohl, and V. Grau, "Towards high-resolution
	cardiac atlases: ventricular anatomy descriptors for a
	standardized reference frame", STACOM MICCAI'10, Beijing, 2010.

2010-06-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips.m

	- Instead of assigning the top and botton of the crest to the last
	and first axis points, just compute from each slice the closest
	axis point. Now there is no need for the axis and the right
	ventricle to have the same number of slices.

2010-06-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m.

	- Inter atrio-ventricular surface.

2010-06-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Attempt to recompute the image resolution when the image is
	rotated. Imagine we have a 2D image with 1x2 resolution, and
	rotate it 90º. With the current code, the rotated image would
	still have 1x2 resolution, but it would make sense that it changes
	to 2x1. Anyway, I need to test the new code, and have no time now,
	so I'm leaving the code commented out to work on it later.

2010-06-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/crest_envelope.m:

	- Compute the envelope for the Right Ventricle's crest.

2010-05-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/process_misas_patient.m

	- Remove assumption that subdirectories with IMA files are called
	MISAS*. We need this because Jason will rename the MISAS*
	directories to NormalMri1, FatMri1, etc. before running this
	script.

2010-05-27  Ramon Casero  <ramc@clpc444.comlab>

	* Add CardiacToolbox/process_misas_patient.m

	- Create MetaImage volumes from directory tree of IMA DICOM files,
	for project with human hearts provided by Kelvin Wong.

	* FileFormatToolbox/sortdirbynum.m:

	- Fix bug. Exit gracefully when list of input files is empty.

2010-05-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add CardiacToolbox/correct_rv_crescent_tips.m

	- Correct the segmentation of the Right Ventricle's crescent tips
	using the segmentation of the tricuspid and pulmonary annula.

2010-05-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips.m

	- Extend computation of the RV crescent tips to the RV slices that
	have no corresponding centroid. In that case the first and last
	centroids in the LV axis are used.

2010-05-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/coords_from_dist_gower.m

	- Compute point coordinates from distances to a set of landmarks,
	as described in Gower (1986).

2010-05-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/WriteMhaFile.m

	- Fix bug, wrong variable name and function in error message.

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m

	- Fix bug when directory in path is the current one.

	* Add PointsToolbox/dmatrix.m

	- Matrix of distances between vectors. Move from Comlab
	repository, matlab-toolbox/misc/trunk.

2010-04-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m:

	- Fix bug with dir name when data is in the current directory.

2010-04-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_gradients.m:

	- Vicente suggested using an explicit formula with a 3x3
	neighbourhood to compute the second order gradients, instead of
	running function gradient() twice (which uses a 5x5 neighbourhood).

2010-03-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/dijkstra.cpp:

	- Nodes not connected to the source get a NaN as parent. They were
	getting a 1, which is a bug. By making it NaN, it also mimics the
	output of Matlog Toolbox's function dijk(), that has a native
	Matlab implementation of the same algorithm.

	* Add CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips.m:

	- Extract the tips of the crescent-shaped curve in all slices of
	the Right Ventricle.

	* Add CardiacToolbox/is_lv_on_the_left.m:

	- Check whether the left ventricle is on the left hand side of the
	image.

	* Add CardiacToolbox subdirectory for functions that are specific
	to cardiac image processing.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/dijkstra.m,
	ThirdPartyToolbox/dijkstra.cpp, ThirdPartyToolbox/fibheap.h:

	- DIJKSTRA Shortests path tree from sparse matrix graph.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/LICENCE

	- To explan licence difference of files in this subdirectory.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox directory for derivative works or third
	party functions that cannot be covered by the GPL used elsewhere
	in Gerardus, or code with an uncertain licence status.

	* FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.m:

	- Add Matlab implementation of the function, to compare with the
	MEX implementation.

2010-03-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.cpp,
	FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.m:

	- Convert image to adjacency-distance list in sparse matrix form.

	* Add PointsToolbox/sparse_breakdown.cpp,
	PointsToolbox/sparse_breakdown.m:

	- Extract internal arrays from sparse matrix.

2010-03-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_gradients.m:

	- Compute 1st and 2nd order image gradients.

2010-03-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_centroids.m:

	- Instead of skipping them, make [NaN NaN NaN] centroid for empty
	slices too. This way, it's easier to use them in other functions
	that iterate all the slices in a volume.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_centroids.m:

	- Compute centroid of every slice with segmented pixels.

2010-03-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m, PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- Remove rounding of index values to allow for continuous
	indices. This way, numerical errors are reduced. In case we need
	integer indices, it's very easy to run round(idx) on the output.

	- Rename argument axis as ax, to avoid clash with function axis().

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_regionprops.m:

	- SCINRRD_REGIONPROPS Measure properties of image regions on each
	slice.

2010-03-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m, PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- Add input argument "center", so that we can choose the
	transformation A(X-M) instead of A(X-M)+M. This will center the
	heart around the origin of coordinates, and it also allows to use
	a well-conditioned system to be used in extmat2rotmat.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_vertical_orientation_pca_basis.m:

	- Remove input argument "type". We are computing an orientation
	basis, not a rotation matrix, so there's no point in having "type"
	to select between A or A'.

	* Rename scinrrd_vertical_rot3.m as
	scinrrd_vertical_orientation_pca_basis.m:

	- We are computing the orientation basis, not a rotation matrix.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_vertical_rot3.m:

	- Make sure that the orientation of the resulting basis is the
	same as the Cartesian system.

	The problem is that the basis is valid if we take the negative of
	any of its vectors too. For example, the Cartesian system has
	positive orientation because [1 0 0] x [0 1 0] = [0 0 1]. But
	scinrrd_vertical_rot3() could also produce the basis with negative
	orientation [-1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1].

	To avoid this, we make sure that the "Z" vector is going up,
	and then change the sign of "X", if necessary.

2010-03-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Reorder input arguments, so that now filename is at the
	end. This way, we can use xargs on the shell and rotate a
	list of files.

	- Major bug fix. Input transformation was all mixed up. Now the
	input transformation is expected to be in the intuitive
	direction. For example, if you want to rotate the volume 30º
	clockwise, your transformation should rotate the Cartesian system
	30º clockwise too.

	- Add input argument to select autocrop, so that the output volume
	will tightly enclose the selected voxels in a segmentation mask,
	or you can also define margins by a percentage.

	* Add CardiacToolbox, a directory to keep functions that are only
	relevant to cardiac image processing.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_papillary_muscles.m:

	- Extract the papillay muscles from a segmentation of the Left
	Ventricle's cavity.

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m:

	- SCINRRD_SAVE Save a NRRD struct to a Matlab format that can be
	imported by Seg3D.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_unsqueeze.m:

	- SCINRRD_UNSQUEEZE  Add dummy dimension and convert data to uint8
	data type.

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m:

	- SCINRRD_LOAD Load a NRRD struct saved to Matlab format.

2010-03-02  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Add input argument to select the interpolator type. Now we can
	choose between bspline or nearest neighbour. The reason is that
	bspline was giving bad results for binary masks (but works well
	for grayscale images).

2010-02-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Change syntax. Instead of giving the centroid and rotation
	matrix, in that order, we are expecting the (3,4) extended matrix,
	that contains the rotation matrix and a translation vector.

	* PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m, PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- Remove the bottom row of the extended matrix.

2010-02-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Make default background colour 0, and add input argument to be
	able to change it.

	* Add PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m:

	- EXTMAT2ROTMAT Convert rotation in extended matrix form into
	centroid and matrix pair.

	* Add PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- ROTMAT2EXTMAT  Convert centroid and rotation matrix pair to
	extended matrix form.

2010-02-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/intersect_line_plane.m:

	- INTERSECT_LINE_PLANE Find intersection of a line with a plane.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_box.m:

	- SCINRRD_BOX Compute tight box around SCI NRRD segmentation.

2010-02-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Interface change: Change input arguments.

	- Now, instead of intering RAD for smoothing of the segmentation,
	we enter a struct called param, that contains new options for the
	optimisation.

	- Added global optimisation, that is, instead of using fminsearch,
	now you can sweep a whole range of azimuth and elevation angles to
	compute the area values. Because we are optimising only two
	variables, this is not much slower than using fminsearch, and it
	provides a much better insight into the results.

	* PointsToolbox/vec2rotmat.m:

	- Add input argument so that an initial guess for the 2 vectors
	orthogonal to V is provided (as part of an initial guess for the
	rotation matrix). This will constrain the infinite space of
	possible rotations to the closest one to the one we had.

2010-02-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m:

	- Real world coordinates are to be presented as (x,y,z), while
	indices are to be presented as (r,c,s). But note that x <-> c, and
	y <-> r.

	* PointsToolbox/scinrrd_pca.m:

	- Fix bug: The convention has to be that rows are y-coordinates,
	and columns are x-coordinates.

	* PointsToolbox/plotaxes.m:

	- Add input argument for the origin of coordinates.

2010-02-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Remove unnecessary function nesting.

2010-02-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Interface change: Change argument order.

	- Now instead of computing a rotation centroid at 2/3 of the
	volume, the user enters the rotation centroid.

	- The rotation centroid stays fixed and is not recomputed at each
	iteration of the optimisation algorithm (actually it is, for
	tracking purposes, but the value used is the initial).

	- Remove big block to compute the instersection area at iteration
	zero, as this can be now done within the optimisation loop.

	- Optimise the azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector,
	instead of the 3 coordinates of the vector.

	- Use new vec2rotmat() function to compute rotation matrix from
	the normal vector.

	* Add PointsToolbox/vec2rotmat.m:

	- VEC2ROTMAT Compute rotation matrix from Cartesian vector.

	* Add PointsToolbox/plotaxes.m:

	- PLOTAXES Plot axes of 3D coordinate system.

2010-02-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Undo change of vector arguments to matrices, because we can do
	the optimisation on the sole vector, and then recompute the
	rotation matrix.

	But keep renaming of function being used by this function.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- Force NRRD data to be double, otherwise interpolation for the
	intersection doesn't work.

	* PointsToolbox/scinrrd_pca.m:

	- Remove assumption that NRRD will have dummy dimension, because
	it could have been removed by a previous scinrrd function.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_vertical_rot3.m:

	- Replace code block by scinrrd_vertical_rot3().

	- Add input argument so that you can select whether the rotation
	is forwards or backwards.

	* PointsToolbox/scinrrd_pca.m:

	- Compute centroid as output argument.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_world2index.m as
	scinrrd_world2index.m. Correct variables and help header for
	consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_index2world.m as
	scinrrd_index2world.m. Correct variables and help header for
	consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_pca.m as scinrrd_pca.m. Correct variables and
	help header for consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_vertical_rot3.m as
	scinrrd_vertical_rot3. Correct help header. Correct variables and
	help header for consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

2010-02-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m as
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- When sampling with interpn(), it is necessary to provide the
	grid matrices in the same order as they are generated by ndgrid().

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_seg3d2matlab.m:

	- SCINRRD_SEG3D2MATLAB Correct dimensions of data loaded from SCI
	NRRD so that rows and columns will follow Matlab's coordinates.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_ndgrid.m:

	- Fix bug. Limits for x-coordinates were used for y-coordinates
	and viceversa.

2010-02-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Remove temporal code. Add avals, vvals, mvals as output
	arguments to monitor evolution of optimisation algorithm. Add v0,
	rad as input arguments, so that the initial vector is not hard
	coded, and radius of smoothing operators.

2010-02-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Remove quaternions and use the normal vector to the plane as
	optimization variable. The function has some debugging code, it's
	still in development. The optimisation is getting trapped in local
	minima; it's not clear whether this is because of the
	trabeculations, or because the normal vector is not a good
	parameter to optimise.

2010-02-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- SCINRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE  Compute intersection of a plane with an
	SCI NRRD image volume.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_squeeze.m:

	- SCINRRD_SQUEEZE Remove dummy dimension and convert data to
	double type.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_ndgrid.m:

	- Generation of arrays for 3D SCI NRRD image volumes.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- SCIRUNNRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE  Optimise intersection plane for SCI
	NRRD segmentation mask.

	- Remove some redundant lines of code.

2010-01-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/scirunnrrd_pca.m:

	- SCIRUNNRRD_PCA Principal Principal Component Analysis of the
	selected points in a SCI NRRD segmentation mask.

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_pca.m:

	- PTS_PCA Linear and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA and
	KPCA).

	This function was in my internal repository (r9953, v3.0,
	2008-06-14 22:07:56 +0100). I started developing it for my DPhil
	thesis at the Wolfson Medical Vision Laboratory, University of

	Component Analysis (PCA and KPCA).

	This function was in my internal repository (r7928, v2.3,
	2007-08-26 17:20:26 +0100). I started developing it for my DPhil
	thesis at the Wolfson Medical Vision Laboratory, University of
	Oxford (2007-06-09 15:27:07 +0100).

2009-12-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m:

2009-11-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2mat.m:

	- In case of a time series, we assume that all frames for slice 1
	are in consecutive DICOM files. Then all the frames for slice 2,
	and so on.

	Note that the output matrix is permuted to have the indices in the
	order (I,J,N,F), where N is the slice index and F is the frame
	index.

2009-11-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2mat.m:

	- Add block to detect time series and create 4D volumes, if
	necessary.

	Matlab Toolbox.

	- http://code.google.com/p/gerardus

	* Add README with help for functions in the Toolbox.

	* WriteMetaFile.h -> WriteRawFile.h:

	- Correct name, as "Meta" could refer to MetaImage, the format
	that includes both the mha header and the raw file.

	* dcm2metadata.m -> dcm2metaimage.m, im2metadata.m ->
	im2metaimage.m:

	Correct filenames and function names, because we are create
	MetaImage files, not "metadata".

	* Add LICENCE with text of the GPL v3, and corresponding copyright
	notices to all files.

2009-04-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add correct_light_blobs_in_microscope_mosaic.m:

	- CORRECT_LIGHT_BLOBS_IN_MICROSCOPE_MOSAIC Correct the colour blob
	created by the microscope's light in each tile of a mosaic,
	e.g. for histology.

	as a single metadata volume (one .mha and one .raw file).

2009-01-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* WriteMhaFile.m, WriteMetaFile.m: v0.2.

	- Add MET_USHORT as output type for uint16 input data.

	- Add error message if the data type is not one of the expected
	types. Otherwise, no ElementType header is added to the file, this
	is not reported, and then Seg3D (and possibly other image
	visualisation applications) will fail to open the file.
