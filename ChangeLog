	* release 0.6.0:

	- Big improvement to itk_imfilter(). Before, we were creating an
	itk::Image for the input, and copying there the Matlab input
	buffer. Also, copying the filter outputs to Matlab output
	buffers. But now, we graft the Matlab buffers directly into the
	filter, so no copying is necessary. This saves time, and also
	memory, as no duplicates of the input and outputs are performed.

	In the case of some outputs, copying may be necessary. For
	example, if the filter gives an extra output where each voxel is a
	vector. We cannot return that directly, so we need to process that
	output and copy the result to a Matlab buffer.

	* release 0.5.0:

	- Now itk_imfilter() supports passing parameters to filters. This
	last version hasn't been tested with Windows yet.

	* release 0.4.0

	- Now the MEX ITK functions itk_imfilter(),
	itk_kernel_transform(), and the filter bwregiongrow() compile and
	run under Windows XP 32-bit too. (Built with CMake 2.8 and Visual
	Studio 10).

	* release 0.3

	- After releasing first versions of functions in matlab/ItkToolbox
	that allow to run ITK code from Matlab.
