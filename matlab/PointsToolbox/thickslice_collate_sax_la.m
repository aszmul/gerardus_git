% THICKSLICE_COLLATE_SAX_LA  Build a distance/adjacency matrix collating
% points from a Long Axis plane to a set of Short Axis planes
%
% [XOUT, DOUT] = thickslice_collate_sax_la(XSAX, DSAX, XLA, K)
%
%   XSAX is a 3-column matrix where each row has the coordinates of a set
%   of points distributed on short axis (SAX) slices.
%
%   DSAX is a square matrix with the distance/adjacency between the points
%   in XSAX.
%
%   XLA is a 3-column matrix with the coordinates of a set of points
%   distributed on a long axis (LA) slice. The LA slice is usually assumed
%   to be more or less orthogonal to the SAX slices, although it doesn't
%   need to be exactly so.
%
%   K is a scalar with the number of nearest neighbours that are
%   considered. By default, K=3.
%
%   XOUT is a 3-colum matrix with the concatenation of XSAX and XLA.
%
%   DOUT is the distance/adjacency matrix for the collated SAX and LA
%   points.
