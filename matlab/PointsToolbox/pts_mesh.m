function [tri, triboundary] = pts_mesh(x, maxlen)
% PTS_MESH  Tetrahedral volumetric and triangular surface mesh of a cloud
% of points
%
% [TRI, TRIBOUNDARY] = PTS_MESH(X, MAXLEN)
%
%   X is a 3-column array where each row has the Cartesian coordinates of a
%   point from the cloud of points. If you have a segmentation in SCI NRRD
%   format, you can compute the coordinates of the segmented voxels as
%
%     >> [r, c, s] = ind2sub(size(nrrd.data), find(nrrd.data));
%     >> x = scinrrd_index2world([r c s], nrrd.axis);
%
%   MAXLEN is a scalar with the maximum length allowed for an edge
%   connecting two nodes in the mesh. By default, MAXLEN=Inf, so the mesh
%   will be the convex hull of the cloud of points. This is usually *not*
%   the wanted result. A sensible value of MAXLEN is e.g. 1.75 * L, where L
%   is the length of the voxel diagonal.
%
%   TRI is a 4-column matrix with the description of the mesh
%   (triangulation). Each row contains the indices of 4 vertices forming a
%   tetrahedron. For example, the coordinates of the 2nd vertex of the 50th
%   tetrahedron can be obtained as X(TRI(50, 2), :).
%
%   To plot the volumetric mesh you can use (but note that this is very
%   slow even for small meshes)
%
%     >> tetramesh(tri)
%
%   TRIBOUNDARY is a 3-row array. Each column has the indices of 3 points
%   that form a triangle on the surface of the mesh. To plot the surface
%   mesh (usually very fast) you can use
%
%     >> trisurf(triboundary, x(:, 1), x(:, 2), x(:, 3), 'EdgeColor', 'none')
%     >> axis xy equal
%     >> camlight('headlight')
%     >> lighting gouraud
%
%   To obtain a list of indices of the points on the surface,
%
%     >> idx = unique(triboundary(:));
