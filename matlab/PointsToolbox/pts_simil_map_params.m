function [rforms, rformh, rformt] = pts_simil_map_params(y, x)
% PTS_SIMIL_MAP_PARAMS  Compute similarity transformation parameters
% between sets of points with unknown correspondence (Procrustes is used)
%
% [RFORMS, RFORMH, RFORMT] = PTS_SIMIL_MAP_PARAMS(Y, X)
%
%   In their simplest form:
%
%     Y: target point set
%     X: source point set
%
%   A point set is a (P,2)-matrix, where each row has the Cartesian
%   coordinates of a 2D point.
%
%   RFORMS, RFORMH and RFORMT are matrices with the parameters of the
%   similarity transformation that better maps X onto Y, in the least
%   squares sense.
%
%     RFORMS: s or scaling factor, (N,1)-vector
%     RFORMH: h or rotation matrix, (2,2,N)-matrix
%     RFORMT: t or translation vector, (N,2)-vector
%
%   The similarity transformation on a point [x1 x2] is
%
%     [z1 z2] = s * [x1 x2] * h + t
%
%   Input argument allowed sizes:
%
%     Y is (P,2), X is (P,2,N) => RFORMS is (N,1)-vector
%        RFORS(i) corresponds to X(:,:,i) -> Y
%        (similarly with RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
%     Y is (P,2,N), X is (P,2) => RFORMS is (N,1)-vector
%        RFORS(i) corresponds to X -> Y(:,:,i)
%        (similarly with RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
%     Y is (P,2,N), X is (P,2,N) => RFORMS is (N,1)-vector
%        RFORS(i) corresponds to X(:,:,i) -> Y(:,:,i)
%        (similarly with RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
% NB. The reason for not using a struct to hold all parameters is because
% it is e.g. ~20% faster to do the rotations with normal matrices than with
% matrices in structs.
