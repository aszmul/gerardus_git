% PTS_PROCRUSTES Least-Squares Fit Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis between
% two sets of points
%
% [Y1, Y2] = PTS_PROCRUSTES(X1, X2)
%
%    X1, X2 are sets of points with dimensions (P,K), where P is the
%    number of points in a set, and K the dimension of each point.
%
%    Y1, Y2 are scaled (square root of sum of squared distances = 1) and
%    zero centered versions of X1, X2. Besides, Y2 has been rotated to
%    match Y1 using Least-Squares Fit Orthogonal Procrustes analysis (a
%    form of similarity registration) as described in [1, pp. 41-42].
%
% [Y1, Y2, SSE, S1, S2, H, T1, T2] = PTS_PROCRUSTES(...)
%
%    SSE is the sum of squared differences between Y1 and Y2.
%
%    The similarity transformation that maps each point [x1, x2] to point 
%    [y1, y2] is formulated as
%
%       y1 = x1 .* S1 + T1
%       y2 = x2 * H .* S2 + T2
%
%    where 
%       H is the rotation matrix. Note: In 2D, the counterclockwise
%       definition of H is
%          H = [cos(phi) sin(phi) ; -sin(phi) cos(phi)]
%       and the clockwise
%          H = [cos(phi) -sin(phi) ; sin(phi) cos(phi)]
%       S1, S2 are the scaling factor, or sum of the squared distances of
%       each point to the object's centroid;
%       T1, T2 are translations expressed as (1, 2) vectors.
