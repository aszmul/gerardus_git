function y = pts_simil_map(x, rforms, rformh, rformt)
% PTS_SIMIL_MAP  Apply similarity transformation to points
%
% Y = PTS_SIMIL_MAP(X, RFORMS, RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
%   X, Y are (P,2,N)-matrices of point configurations, i.e. each X(:,:,i)
%   point configuration is mapped to a Y(:,:,i) point configuration.
%
%   RFORMS, RFORMH and RFORMT are matrices with the parameters of the
%   similarity transformation that better maps X onto Y, in the least
%   squares sense.
%
%     RFORMS: s or scaling factor, (N,1)-vector
%     RFORMH: h or rotation matrix, (2,2,N)-volume
%     RFORMT: t or translation vector, (N,2)-matrix
%
%   The similarity transformation on a point [x1 x2] is
%
%     [y1 y2] = s * [x1 x2] * h + t
%
%   Input argument allowed sizes:
%
%     X is (P,2,N), RFORMS is scalar
%        (similarly with RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
%     X is (P,2), RFORMS is (N,1)-vector
%        (similarly with RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
%     X is (P,2,N), RFORMS is (N,1)-vector
%        (similarly with RFORMH, RFORMT)
%
% Y = PTS_SIMIL_MAP(X, Q)
%
%     Q is a 4-vector with the similarity transformation parameters
%
%     RFORMT = [Q(1), Q(2)]
%     RFORMS = 1+Q(3)
%     RFORMH = [cos(Q(4)) sin(Q(4));
%               -sin(Q(4)) cos(Q(4))]
%
%     Q can also be a matrix where each column is a 4-vector.
