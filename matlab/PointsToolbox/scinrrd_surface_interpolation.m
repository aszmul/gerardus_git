function nrrd = scinrrd_surface_interpolation(nrrd, x, PARAM, INTERP, KLIM)
% SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION  Interpolate a surface and create a
% segmentation mask from a scattered set of points
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION(NRRD0, X)
%
%   NRRD0 is the SCI NRRD struct that contains the image.
%
%   X is a 3-row matrix. Each column has the coordinates of a point that
%   belongs to the surface we want to interpolate.
%
%   NRRD is a SCI NRRD struct with a segmentation of the surface that
%   interpolates the points in X.
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION(NRRD0, X, PARAM, INTERP, KLIM)
%
%   PARAM is a string with the method used to parametrize the surface and
%   X:
%
%     'xy' (default): No change, the X coordinates are kept the same.
%
%     'pca': X points are rotated according to their eigenvectors to make
%     the dominant plane of the points X as horizontal as possible before
%     interpolating.
%
%     'isomap': Use the Isomap method by [1] to "unfold" the curved surface
%     defined by X before interpolating. (This option requires function
%     IsomapII).
%
%   INTERP is a string with the interpolation method:
%
%      'tps' (default): Thin-plate spline. Global support.
%
%      'tsi': Matlab's TriScatteredInterp() function. Local support,
%      limited to the convex hull of the scattered points 2D projection on
%      the interpolation domain.
%
%      'gridfit': John D'Errico's gridfit() function [3] (note:
%      approximation, rather than interpolation). Local support with
%      extrapolation outside the convex hull.
%
%      'mba' Multilevel B-Spline Approximation Library by SINTEF ICT [4].
%      Local support, limited to a rectangle that tighly contains the
%      scattered points 2D projection on the interpolation domain.
%
%   KLIM is a scalar factor for the extension of the interpolation domain.
%   By default, KLIM=1 and the interpolation domain is a rectangle that
%   tightly contains X. Sections of the interpolated surface that protude
%   from the image volume are removed.

%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
