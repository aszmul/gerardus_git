function nrrd = scinrrd_surface_interpolation(nrrd, x, PARAM, INTERP, KLIM)
% SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION  Interpolate a surface and create a
% segmentation mask from a scattered set of points
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION(NRRD0, X)
%
%   NRRD0 is the SCI NRRD struct that contains the image.
%
%   X is a 3-row matrix. Each column has the coordinates of a point that
%   belongs to the surface we want to interpolate.
%
%   NRRD is a SCI NRRD struct with a segmentation of the surface that
%   interpolates the points in X.
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION(NRRD0, X, PARAM, INTERP, KLIM)
%
%   PARAM is a string with the method used to parametrize the surface and
%   X. For options, see help surface_interpolation.m.
%
%   INTERP is a string with the interpolation method. For options, see help
%   surface_interpolation.m.
%
%   KLIM is a scalar factor for the extension of the interpolation domain.
%   By default, KLIM=1 and the interpolation domain is a rectangle that
%   tightly contains X. Sections of the interpolated surface that protude
%   from the image volume are removed.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
