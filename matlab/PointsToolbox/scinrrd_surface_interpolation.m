function [nrrd, uv, x] = scinrrd_surface_interpolation(nrrd, x, param, interp)
% SCINRRD_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION  Interpolate a surface and create a
% segmentation mask from a scattered set of points
%
% NRRD = scinrrd_surface_interpolation(NRRD0, X)
%
%   NRRD0 is the SCI NRRD struct that contains the image.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row has the coordinates of a point that
%   belongs to the surface we want to interpolate.
%
%   NRRD is a SCI NRRD struct with a segmentation of the surface that
%   interpolates the points in X.
%
% [NRRD, UV, X2] = scinrrd_surface_interpolation(NRRD0, X, PARAM, INTERP)
%
%   UV is a 2-column matrix with the parameterisation of X, (U, V)->X. In
%   planar parameterisations, UV has units of meters. In spherical
%   parameterisations, UV=[LON, LAT], in units of radians.
%
%   X2: Some methods (e.g. 'mbae') add extra points to X before computing
%   the interpolants. X2 contains the points actually used for
%   interpolation.
%
%   PARAM is a struct that describes the method used to parametrise the
%   surface and the set of points X, and its parameters. For details, see
%   help surface_interpolation.m.
%
%   INTERP is a struct that describes the interpolation method, and its
%   parameters. For options, see help surface_interpolation.m.
