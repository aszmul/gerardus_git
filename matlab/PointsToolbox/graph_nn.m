function nn = graph_nn(d, idxfrom, idxto, FAST)
% GRAPH_NN  Nearest neighbours from a subset of nodes in a graph to another
% subset
%
% This function establishes a corresponde between two subsets of nodes in a
% graph, so that each node in the first subset corresponds to the closest
% one in the second subset.
%
% NN = GRAPH_NN(D, IDXFROM, IDXTO)
%
%   D is a graph expressed as a sparse or full distance matrix, where
%   D(i,j) is the distance between the i-th and j-th nodes.
%
%   IDXFROM and IDTO are vectors that represent two subsets of nodes in the
%   graph. By default, the vectors contain every node in the graph. So if
%   you want to compute the nearest neighbours from all the nodes to a
%   subset, you can run
%
%     >> nn = graph_nn(d, [], idxto);
%
%   NN is a vector with the same length as IDXFROM. NN(i)==j means that j
%   is the closest node to node i.
%
% NN = GRAPH_NN(..., FAST)
%
%   FAST is a flag to choose whether you want to run the function in
%   vectorized mode (faster), or using a loop (less memory). By default,
%   FAST=true.
%
%
% This function uses a very fast C++ implementation of the Dijkstra
% algorithm by John Boyer and Mark Steyvers.
