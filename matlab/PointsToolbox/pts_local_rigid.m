function yi = pts_local_rigid(x, y, xi, idx)
% PTS_LOCAL_RIGID  Non-rigid transformation that is locally rigid between
% two sets of points with known correspondence
%
%
% This function is useful to warp points when we want distances within
% local neighbourhoods of the points to remain constant.
%
% This function is not diffeormorphic, and in general presents folding
% (i.e. overlapping of warped points).
%
% This function does not suffer from collinearity limitations as other
% warps do (e.g. thin-plate spline, elastic body spline, volume spline,
% affine transformation), so it is useful for e.g. straightening a bent
% tube.
%
% Experiments with this function suggest that arbitrary twisting is not
% introduced in 3D as the object is being straightened.
%
% An smooth alternative to the method provided by this function is a
% B-spline warp, using the MEX function
% ItkToolbox/itk_pstransform('bspline', ...), also provided by Gerardus.
%
% YI = PTS_LOCAL_RIGID(X, Y, XI, IDX)
%
%   X, Y are matrices of the same size, where each row is a point, such
%   that the transformation maps X(i, :) -> Y(i, :).
%
%   XI is a matrix of points that we want to transform. Point in XI must
%   have the same dimension as X and Y, but XI can have a different number
%   of rows.
%
%   IDX is a vector that defines the local neighbourhoods. It has one
%   element per point in XI. For example, IDX(3)==7 means that point 
%   XI(3, :) belongs to the local neighbourhood of X(7, :).
