function a = vec2rotmat(v, a0)
% VEC2ROTMAT  Compute rotation matrix from Cartesian vector
%
% A = VEC2ROTMAT(V)
%
%   V is a 3-vector. We assume that V is a rotation of the Z-axis vector
%   [0,0,1]'.
%
%   A is one of the infinite rotation matrices that rotate the Z-axis
%   vector onto V
%
%     V = A * [0,0,1]'
%
%   In particular, A is the solution that maps the Cartesian coordinate
%   system onto a coordinate system that contains V and where the other two
%   vectors are closest to A in a Gram-Schmidt sense.
%
% A = VEC2ROTMAT(V, A0)
%
%   A0 is a (3,3)-matrix that can be seen as a rotation matrix in 3D, as
%   an orthonormal basis, or a first guess of A. Only the first two columns
%   are used. The two first columns are used together with V as the initial
%   non-orthogonal basis. When A0 is not provided, then the identity matrix
%   is used, i.e.g A0 = eye(3).

% create a non-orthogonal Cartesian basis where the Z-axis vector is
% replaced by v
v = [ a0( :, 1:2 ), v ];

% now we want to apply Gram-Schmidt to this basis to create an orthonormal
% basis. We want to keep v, so we start the Gram-Schmidt process fixing it,
% and then remove the projections of the other two vectors
[a, foo] = qr( v( :, end:-1:1 ) ); % foo is necessary, because the result 
                                   % from a = qr() is different
a = a( :, end:-1:1 );

% check whether we want to keep each vector or the negative, so that they
% are closest to the original basis
