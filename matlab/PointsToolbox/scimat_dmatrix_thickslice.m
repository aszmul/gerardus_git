function [d, points] = scimat_dmatrix_thickslice(scimat, K)
% SCIMAT_DMATRIX_THICKSLICE  Compute a distance/adjacency matrix for a
% segmentation that consists of scattered points in slices wide apart
%
% [D, POINTS] = scimat_dmatrix_thickslice(SCIMAT, K)
%
%   SCIMAT is a structure with the segmentation. The segmentation is
%   assumed to represent scattered points, in slices that are wide apart
%   (because the voxels are very thick in the z-axis, or because only a few
%   slices of the whole volume have been segmented).
%
%   The adjacency matrix is built in two steps:
%
%   First, slices are done independently. Each point in the slice is
%   connected only to its K nearest neighbours.
%
%   Second, each slice is connected to the slices immediately above and
%   below it. Each point is again connected to its K nearest neighbours
%   above, and K nearest neighbours below.
%
%   K is a scalar with the number of nearest neighbours that are
%   considered. By default, K=3.
%
%   D is a matrix PxP, assuming there are P points in SCIMAT. D(i,j) is the
%   Euclidean distance between points i and j only if they are connected.
%   Otherwise, D(i,j)=0.
%
%   POINTS is a Px3 matrix with the real world (x, y, z)-coordinates of the
%   segmented points.
%
% Example:
%
%    scimat = scinrrd_load('test/thick-slice-points.mat');
%    [d, points] = scimat_dmatrix_thickslice(scimat, 2);
%    gplot3d(d, points, 'o')
%    hold on
%    gplot3d(d, points)
%    axis equal
