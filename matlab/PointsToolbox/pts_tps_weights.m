%
%    Compute the thin-plate splines warp given by [1], but with the
%    definition of the energy function in [2], both generalised from 2D to
%    N-dimensions.
%
%    For example, in 2D the equation to interpolate a point (x,y) given a
%    configuration of 2D points {Pi} is
%
%       f(x,y,z) = a1 + ax*x + ay*y + sum(wi*U(|Pi - (x,y)|))
%                                           i
%
%    W = [w1_x, ..., wN_x, a1_x, ax_x, ay_x ;
%          w1_y, ..., wN_y, a1_y, ax_y, ay_y]'
%
%    U(r) = r^2 log10(r)
%
%    S, T are matrices with the source and target point coordinates. They
%    do not need to have the same number of columns. 
%
%    For instance, if you want to interpolate the heights on a 2D map of
%    Earth, you would have 2 columns in S for the (x,y)-coordinates, and 1
%    column in T for the height values.
%
%    Another example, if you want to warp a 2D image, then you would have 2
%    columns both in S and T, with the coordinates of corresponding points.
%
%    You can also concatenate S matrices, and T matrices, and use the
%    resulting volumes as the input arguments. In that case, the weights
%    are computed independently for each pair of configurations, i.e.
%
%       W(:,:,1) for S(:,:,1) and T(:,:,1)
%       W(:,:,2) for S(:,:,2) and T(:,:,2)
%       etc.
