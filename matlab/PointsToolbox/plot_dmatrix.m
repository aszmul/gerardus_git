function plot_dmatrix(x, d, LABELS)
% PLOT_DMATRIX  Plot the connections implied by a distance matrix
%
% PLOT_DMATRIX(X)
% PLOT_DMATRIX(X, [])
%
%   This function plots each column of matrix X as a point in 2D or 3D, and
%   lines connecting each point to all others.
%
% PLOT_DMATRIX(X, D)
%
%   If X has N points, D is an (N, N)-matrix with the distances between
%   pairs of points ("Inf" is taken as no connection).
%
% PLOT_DMATRIX(X, D, LABELS)
%
%   LABELS is a flag to indicate whether you want to display numbers close
%   to each point. By default LABELS=false.
