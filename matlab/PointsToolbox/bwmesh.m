function [tri, triboundary] = bwmesh(im, res)
% BWMESH  Tetrahedral volumetric and triangular surface mesh of a binary
% segmentation
%
% [TRI, TRIBOUNDARY] = BWMESH(IM, RES)
%
%   IM is a 3D array with a binary segmentation.
%
%   RES is a 3-vector with the size of the voxel in each coordinate. By
%   default, RES=[1 1 1].
%
%   TRI is a 4-column array where each row contains the indices of 4 nodes
%   forming a tetrahedron. E.g. TRI(2, :)=[23 178 3 90] means that the
%   first tetrahedron contains nodes 23, 178, 3 and 90. Nodes are indexed
%   in the order given by find(IM). For instance, the segmentation
%
%     0 1 1 0
%     1 0 0 0
%     0 1 0 1
%
%   has 5 nodes, with corresponding indices 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
%
%   Example: If you have a SCI NRRD volume
%
%     >> [tri, trisurface] = bwmesh(nrrd.data, [nrrd.axis.spacing]);
%
%   To plot the volumetric mesh you can use (but note that this is very
%   slow even for small meshes)
%
%     >> [r, c, s] = ind2sub(size(nrrd.data), find(nrrd.data));
%     >> x = scinrrd_index2world([r c s], nrrd.axis);
%     >> tetramesh(tri, x(:, 1), x(:, 2), x(:, 3))
%
%   TRIBOUNDARY is a 3-column array. Each row has the indices of 3 nodes
%   that form a triangle on the surface of the mesh. To plot the surface
%   mesh (usually very fast) you can use
%
%     >> trisurf(triboundary, x(:, 1), x(:, 2), x(:, 3), 'EdgeColor', 'none')
%     >> axis xy equal
%     >> camlight('headlight')
%     >> lighting gouraud
%
%   To obtain a list of all nodes on the surface,
%
%     >> idx = unique(triboundary(:));
