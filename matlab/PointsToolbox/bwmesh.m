function [tri, triboundary] = bwmesh(im, res)
% BWMESH  Tetrahedral volumetric and triangular surface mesh of a binary
% segmentation
%
% [TRI, TRIBOUNDARY] = BWMESH(IM, RES)
%
%   IM is a 3D array with a binary segmentation.
%
%   RES is a 3-vector with the size of the voxel in each coordinate. By
%   default, RES=[1 1 1].
%
%   TRI is a 'TriRep' struct with the description of the mesh. To plot the
%   volumetric mesh you can use (but note that this is very slow even for
%   small meshes)
%
%     >> tetramesh(tri)
%
%   TRIBOUNDARY is a 3-row array. Each column has the indices of 3 points
%   that form a triangle on the surface of the mesh. To plot the surface
%   mesh (usually very fast) you can use
%
%     >> trisurf(triboundary, x(:, 1), x(:, 2), x(:, 3))
%
%   To obtain a list of indices of the points on the surface,
%
%     >> idx = unique(triboundary(:));
