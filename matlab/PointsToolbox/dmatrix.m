function d = dmatrix(x, y, METHOD)
% DMATRIX  Matrix of distances between vectors
%
% D = DMATRIX(X)
%
%   D(i,j) is the Euclidean distance between X(:,i) and X(:,j)
%
% D = DMATRIX(X, Y)
%
%   D(i,j) is the Euclidean distance between X(:,i) and Y(:,j)
%
% D = DMATRIX(X, Y, METHOD)
%
%   METHOD is a string with the type of distance measured. By default,
%   METHOD='euclidean'. METHOD='centrip' computes the centripetal
%   distance [1].
