function itk_kernel_transform
% ITK_KERNEL_TRANSFORM  ITK warps between 3D point sets with a known
% correspondence
%
% This MEX-function provides a Matlab interface to run ITK's Kernel
% Transforms:
%
%   itk::ElasticBodySplineKernelTransform
%   itk::ElasticBodyReciprocalSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::ThinPlateSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::ThinPlateR2LogRSplineKernelTransform
%   itk::VolumeSplineKernelTransform
%
% YI = KERNELTRANSFORM(X, Y, XI, TYPE)
%
%   X, Y are 3-column matrices with N rows. Each row has the
%   coordinates of a point. The warp is defined so that
%   X(i,:)->Y(i,:).
%
%   XI is a 3-column matrix with M rows. Each row has the coordinates
%   of a point to be warped.
%
%   YI has the same dimensions as XI. YI contains the coordinates of
%   the warped points.
%
%   TYPE is a string that allows to select the type of warp (no defaults):
%
%   'elastic':  itk::ElasticBodySplineKernelTransform
%   'elasticr': itk::ElasticBodyReciprocalSplineKernelTransform
%   'tps':      itk::ThinPlateSplineKernelTransform
%   'tpsr2':    itk::ThinPlateR2LogRSplineKernelTransform
%   'volume':   itk::VolumeSplineKernelTransform
%
%  To compile and install this function to PointToolbox, you need to have
%  installed the Insight Toolkit C++ files and Matlab.
%
% This function must be compiled before it can be used from Matlab.
% If Gerardus' root directory is e.g. ~/gerardus, type from a
% linux shell
%
%    $ cd ~/gerardus/matlab
%    $ mkdir bin
%    $ cd bin
%    $ cmake ..
%    $ make install
%
% If cmake throws an error because it cannot find Matlab, then edit
% gerardus/matlab/CMakeLists.txt, and where it says
%
%    SET(MATLAB_ROOT "/usr/local/matlab/R2010b/")
%
%  change to your own Matlab root path.
