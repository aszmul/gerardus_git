function [y, w] = pts_tps_map(s, t, x, w, FAST, PROGRESS)
% PTS_TPS_MAP  Interpolate/warp/map N-dimensional points using a thin-plate
% spline transformation
%
% [Y, W] = PTS_TPS_MAP(S, T, X, W)
%
%    S is a (P,Ds,N)-volume where each (:,:,i)-matrix has the coordinates
%    of the source points that define the warp.
%
%    T is a (P,Dt,N)-volume where each (:,:,i)-matrix has the coordinates
%    of the target points that define the warp.
%
%      (P is the number of points, Ds and Dt are the dimension and N is the
%      number of configurations).
%
%    X is a (P,Ds,N)-volume where each (:,:,i)-matrix has the coordinates
%    of the points to be interpolated.
%
%    Y is a (P,Dt,N)-volume with the interpolated points.
%
%    W is a D2-column matrix where each column has the weight and affine
%    weights vector computed with PTS_TSP_WEIGHTS (if W is empty or
%    missing, then W is computed internally).
%
% ... = PTS_TPS_MAP(S, T, X, W, FAST)
%
%    To speed up computations, all points in the same configuration are
%    warped together using vector and matrix operations.
%
%    This is more memory expensive. If for some reason memory becomes a
%    problem, using FAST=false it is possible to run the algorithm using
%    a "for" loop to warp 1 point at a time. This is roughly 14 times
%    slower. By default the faster method is used, FAST=true.
%
% ... = PTS_TPS_MAP(S, T, X, W, FAST, PROGRESS)
%
%    Making PROGRESS=true, and if you have function STATUSBAR() by
%    Leutenegger Marcel, you will see a progress bar with an estimate of
%    the time remaining to completion if you are using the slow method.
