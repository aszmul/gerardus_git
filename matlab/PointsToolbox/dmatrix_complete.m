function d = dmatrix_complete(d)
% DMATRIX_COMPLETE  Fill in empty elements of non-Euclidean distance matrix
%
% D2 = DMATRIX_COMPLETE(D1)
%
%   D1 is a sparse distance matrix that represents the connectivity of a
%   set of points in a non-Euclidean space.
%
%   That is, not all points are connected to each other. (Note that lack of
%   connection in the sparse matrix is represented by a 0 element).
%
%   D2 is a full matrix with the distances between every pair of points.
%   For points that are not directly connected, their distance is computed
%   using Dijkstra's algorithm over the connection graph.
%
% This function uses a very fast implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
% written by Mark Steyvers.
