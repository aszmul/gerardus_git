function d2 = gram2dsq(g)
% GRAM2DSQ  Convert Gram matrix to squared distance matrix
%
% D2 = GRAM2DSQ(G)
%
%   G is a Gram matrix. The Gram matrix of matrix Y, where each column has
%   the coordinates of a point, is G = Y'*Y.
%
%   D2 is the matrix of squared Euclidean distances between the points in
%   Y. Note that if Y is available, D2 = DMATRIX(Y).^2 = GRAM2DSQ(Y'*Y).
