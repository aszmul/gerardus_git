function x = intersect_line_plane(mx, nx, p0, p1, p2)
% INTERSECT_LINE_PLANE  Find intersection of a line with a plane
%
% X = INTERSECT_LINE_PLANE(MX, NX, P0, P1, P2)
%
%   MX, NX are 3-vectors that represent, respectively, a point and the
%   direction vector of a line in 3D.
%
%   P0, P1, P2 are 3-vectors that represent 3 non-collinear points on a
%   plane.
%
%   X is a 3-vector with the coordinates of the intersection between the
%   line and the plane.
%
%   All vectors are column vectors.
