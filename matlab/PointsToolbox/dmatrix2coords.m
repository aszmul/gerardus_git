function v = dmatrix2coords(d, m)
% DMATRIX2COORDS  Point coordinates from distance matrix
%
%   This function computes the coordinates of a set of points if all we
%   know is the distances between them.
%
% X = DMATRIX2COORDS(D, M)
%
%   D is an (N,N)-square matrix, where D(i,j) is the Euclidean distance
%   between the i-th and j-th points.
%
%   M is a scalar with the dimension of the points (this information cannot
%   be extracted from the distance matrix). For example, if the points are
%   3D, then M=3. By default, M=N.
%
%   X is an (M, N)-matrix where each column has the coordinates of a point.
%   If you compute the distance matrix of V, you obtain D again.
%
%     >> D = dmatrix(X);
%
%   Note that any rotation or translation on X produces the same D. Thus, X
%   is not necessarily the same configuration that produced D originally.
%
%   Note also that due to numerical errors, it's possible that some
%   small complex values creep into the solution.
%
% This function implements the method in Gower (1966), that is better
% explained in Gower (1968).
