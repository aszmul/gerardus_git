function [m, a] = polycenter(x,y)
% POLYCENTER  Compute center of mass and area of polygon
%
% [M, A] = POLYCENTER(X, Y)
%
%   M is a 2-vector with the coordinates of the center of mass of a
%   polygon.
%
%   A is the polygon area.
%
%   X, Y are vectors with the coordinates of the polygon vertices.
