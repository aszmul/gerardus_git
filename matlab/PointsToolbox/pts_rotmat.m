function h = pts_rotmat(x1, x2)
% PTS_ROTMAT  Compute rotation matrix to minimize least squares error
%
% H = PTS_ROTMAT(X1, X2)
%
%    X1, X2 are two sets of points with dimensions (P, K) where P is the
%    number of points of dimension K.
% 
%    H is a rotation matrix with dimensions (K, K) of X2 onto X1, such that
%    the approximation between X1 and X2*H is optimal in the least squares
%    sense. Note: In 2D, the counterclockwise definition of H is
%
%      H = [cos(phi) sin(phi) ; -sin(phi) cos(phi)]
%
%    and the clockwise
%
%      H = [cos(phi) -sin(phi) ; sin(phi) cos(phi)]
