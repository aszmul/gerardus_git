function [tri, x] = addpoint2tri(tri, x, xi)
% ADDPOINT2TRI  Add one or more nodes to a triangular mesh
%
% This is a not very sophisticated function that allows to add new points
% to an exisiting triangular mesh. Note that it doesn't deal with the case
% when an inserted point is identical to an existing node, or with the case
% when an inserted point is equally closest to more than one facet.
%
% [TRI2, X2] = ADDPOINT2TRI(TRI, X, XI)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix describing a triangular mesh. TRI(i,:) are the
%   indices of the 3 nodes that form the i-th triangle of the mesh.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix with the xyz-coordinates of the nodes.
%
%   XI is a 3-column matrix with the xyz-coordinates of the points we want
%   to insert into the mesh. Each point becomes a node. Iteratively, the
%   closest point to the mesh is chosen. The closest facet to that node is
%   removed and replaced by 3 new triangles, all originating from the new
%   node, and ending on the boundary of the previous facet.
%
%   TRI2, X2 describe the new triangular mesh, after all the points in XI
%   have been added.
