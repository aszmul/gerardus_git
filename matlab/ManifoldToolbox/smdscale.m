function [lat, lon, err, stopCondition, dsph, sphrad] = smdscale(d, sphrad, lat, lon, opt)
% SMDSCALE  Multidimensional scaling on a sphere
%
% This function solves a Multidimensional Scaling problem by finding a way
% to distribute (embed) a set of points on a sphere so that the matrix
% formed from the geodesic distance between connected pairs of points is as
% close as possible (in the Frobenius norm sense) to an input distance
% matrix.
%
% [LAT, LON, ERR, STOP, DSPH, SPHRAD] = smdscale(D)
%
%   D is a square matrix where D(i,j) is some distance (e.g. in meters)
%   between points i and j. Note that the points themselves are unknown, we
%   only know the distances between them. These distances could be geodesic
%   distances, or approximations thereof, e.g. chord-length distances.
%   Values of D(i,j)=0 or D(i,j)=Inf mean that points i and j are not
%   neighbours, i.e. connected by an edge.
%
%   The optimisation algorithm works by relocating each point i so that its
%   new distance on the sphere to each neighbour j is as close to D(i,j) as
%   possible. Note that non-neighbours (D=0 or D=Inf) are ignored in the
%   optimisation. This allows sparse matrices and local neighbourhood
%   optimisations.
%
%   Global optimisations (i.e. the graph is complete, so every pair of
%   points is connected) can be achieved too by converting a local
%   neighbourhood graph to a complete graph:
%
%     D = dijkstra(sparse(D), 1:length(d));
%
%   LAT, LON are vectors with the latitude and longitude coordinates (in
%   radians) of a set of points on the sphere. The great circle distances
%   between the points approximate D as well as possible in the Frobenius
%   norm sense (ignoring Inf values).
%
%   To compute the (x,y,z) Euclidean coordinates of the sphere points run
%
%     [x, y, z] = sph2cart(LON, LAT, SPHRAD);
%
%   ERR is a vector with the Frobenius norm error measure at each step of
%   the optimisation algorithm (moving each point counts as a step).
%
%   STOP is a cell-array with the condition/s that made the algorithm stop,
%   in string form.
%
%   DSPH (units: meters) is the matrix of great circle or geodesic
%   distances between the points given by LAT, LON, and SPHRAD. The great
%   circle distance between points i and j can be computed in Matlab as
%
%     dsph = distance(lat(i), lon(i), lat(j), lon(j), [sphrad 0], 'radians');
%
%   SPHRAD is a scalar with the radius of the sphere. Note that the radius
%   of the sphere is a critical parameter. If the sphere is too small or
%   too large, the algorithm will produce very poor results. By default, it
%   is estimated so that it can accommodate the distance from each point to
%   the most distant point. If D is a local neighbourhood matrix, this
%   requires running a full Dijkstra on D, which may be slow for large
%   matrices. The sphere's radius is estimated from the full D matrix as:
%
%      sphrad = median(max(D)) / pi;
%
% [...] = smdscale(D, SPHRAD, LAT0, LON0, OPT)
%
%   SPHRAD can be provided by the user, in which case it is not estimated
%   internally.
%
%   LAT0, LON0 are the user's initial guess for the latitude and longitude
%   of the point configuration. By default, a configuration of points
%   randomly distributed over the sphere is used.
%
%   OPT is a struct with the stop conditions for the algorithm. The next
%   conditions are available:
%
%     opt.maxiter: (default = 20) maximum number of iterations we allow the
%                  optimisation algorithm. Each iteration consists of an
%                  entire sweep of all points on the sphere.
%
%     opt.fronorm: target value of the Frobenius norm of the distance
%                  matrix error.
%
%     opt.frorel:  relative decrease of the Frobenius norm, e.g. 0.1. This
%                  condition is only considered when the norm is
%                  decreasing, not if it increases.
%
% This function implements the MDS optimisation idea proposed by Agarwal et
% al. (2010), but avoids using chords or approximating the mean on the
% sphere by the Euclidean mean followed by projection on the sphere (code
% not available, but explained in personal communication). It also improves
% on Agarwal et al in that it provides an estimate of the sphere's radius,
% and it can work with a full D matrix or a local neighbourhood D matrix.
% Many thanks to A. Agarwal for his comments about his paper.
