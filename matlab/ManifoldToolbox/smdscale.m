function [lat, lon, err, stopCondition, dsph] = smdscale(d, sphrad, lat, lon, opt)
% SMDSCALE  Multidimensional scaling on a sphere
%
% This function solves a Multidimensional Scaling problem by finding a way
% to distribute (embed) a set of points on a sphere so that the matrix
% formed from the geodesic distance between connected pairs of points is as
% close as possible (in the Frobenius norm sense) to an input distance
% matrix.
%
% [LAT, LON, ERR, STOP, DSPH] = smdscale(D, SPHRAD)
%
%   D is a square matrix where D(i,j) is some distance (e.g. in meters)
%   between the i-th and j-th points. Note that the points themselves are
%   unknown, we only know the distances between them. Values of D(i,j)=0 or
%   D(i,j)=Inf mean that points i, j are not connected. The algorithm only
%   takes into account the neighbours of a point when it's optimised, so if
%   a fully connected distance matrix is needed, run
%
%     D = dijkstra(sparse(D), 1:length(d));
%
%   SPHRAD is a scalar with the radius of the sphere. By default, SPHRAD=1.
%   Note that the radius of the sphere is a critical parameter. E.g. a
%   matrix D with small distance values cannot be proprely fitted to a
%   large sphere (because then we would be trying to embed a spherical
%   point configuration on a surface that is quite similar to a plane).
%
%   LAT, LON are the solution to the problem. They are vectors with the
%   latitude and longitude coordinates (in radians) of a point
%   configuration on the sphere. The arc length distance matrix between
%   said points tries to approximate D as well as possible in the Frobenius
%   norm sense (ignoring Inf values).
%
%   To compute the (x,y,z) Euclidean coordinates of the sphere points run
%
%     [x, y, z] = sph2cart(LON, LAT, SPHRAD);
%
%   ERR is a vector with the error measure at each step of the optimisation
%   algorithm (moving each point counts as a step). The error measure is
%   computed as the Frobenius norm of the matrix (D-DSPH), ignoring
%   infinite distances.
%
%   STOP is a cell-array with the condition/s that made the algorithm stop,
%   in string form.
%
%   DSPH is the matrix of arc length distances between the points given
%   by LAT, LON, SPHRAD (units: meters).
%
% [...] = smdscale(D, SPHRAD, LAT0, LON0, OPT)
%
%   LAT0, LON0 are the user's initial guess for the latitude and longitude
%   of the point configuration. By default, a configuration of points
%   randomly distributed over the sphere is used.
%
%   In some cases, what you want to do is embed a Euclidean or manifold
%   point configuration onto a sphere, i.e. you have a matrix X with the
%   Euclidean coordinates of the points. In this case, you can obtain a
%   good initial guess by running
%
%     [LAT0, LON0, SPHRAD] = proj_on_sphere(X);
%
%   OPT is a struct with the stop conditions for the algorithm. The next
%   conditions are available:
%
%     opt.maxiter: (default = 20) maximum number of iterations we allow the
%                  optimisation algorithm. Each iteration consists of an
%                  entire sweep of all points on the sphere.
%
%     opt.fronorm: target value of the Frobenius norm of the distance
%                  matrix error.
%
%     opt.frorel:  relative decrease of the Frobenius norm, e.g. 0.1. This
%                  condition is only considered when the norm is
%                  decreasing, not if it increases.
%
% This function implements the MDS optimisation idea proposed by Agarwal et
% al. (2010), but avoids using chords or approximating the mean on the
% sphere by the Euclidean mean followed by projection on the sphere (code
% not available, but explained in personal communication). It also improves
% on Agarwal et al in that it does not assume that D is a full matrix, and
% thus can optimise local neighbourhoods of the point configuration. Many
% thanks to A. Agarwal for his comments about his paper.
