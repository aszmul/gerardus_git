function [lat, lon, err, stopCondition, x] = smdscale(d0, x, opt)
% SMDSCALE  Multidimensional scaling on the surface of a sphere
%
% This function solves a Multidimensional Scaling problem by finding a way
% to distribute a set of points on the surface of a sphere so that their
% geodesic distance matrix is close in the Frobenius norm sense to a
% distance matrix provided at the input.
%
% [LAT, LON, ERR, STOP, X] = smdscale(D0)
%
%   D0 is a square matrix where D0(i, j) is the geodesic distance measured
%   in degrees of arc between the i-th and j-th points.
%
%   LAT, LON are vectors with the latitude, longitude coordinates of the
%   point configuration that is the solution to the problem. The matrix of
%   geodesic distances between the points can be computed as
%
%     d = gdmatrix(LAT, LON);
%
%   ERR is a vector of the Frobenius norm of the distance matrix error,
%   i.e. norm(d-D0, 'fro') at each iteration of the algorithm.
%
%   STOP is a string with the condition that made the algorithm stop.
%
%   X is a (3, P)-matrix where each column has the coordinates of one of
%   the points that were used to initialize the algorithm. These points can
%   be provided (see below), or else they are randomly distributed on the
%   sphere.
%
% [LAT, LON, ERR, X] = smdscale(D0, X, OPT)
%
%   X is the (3, P)-matrix mentioned above. If it is provided, then X at
%   the output is the same as X at the input.
%
%   OPT is a struct with the stop conditions for the algorithm. For the
%   moment, only two conditions are available:
%
%     opt.fronorm: value of the Frobenius norm of the distance matrix error
%                  (default 0.001).
%
%     opt.frorel:  relative decrease of the Frobenius norm, e.g. 0.1. This
%                  condition is only considered when the norm is
%                  decreasing, not if it increases.
