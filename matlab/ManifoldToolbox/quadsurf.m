function h = quadsurf(x, y, z, c, varargin)
% QUADSURF  Quadrangular mesh surface plot
%
% quadsurf(X, Y, Z)
%
%   X, Y, Z are matrices with the coordinates of the mesh vertices. Note
%   that with this function it is possible to plot meshes that bend on
%   themselves or are rolled up. This is not possible with Matlab's
%   function surf(), that requires a unique value of Z for each (X,Y) pair.
%
%   This is an example of matrix X for a mesh with 10 rows and 7 columns.
%
%   X(1,1)-----X(1,2)---...---X(1,7)
%    |          |        |      |
%    |          |        |      |
%    |          |        |      |
%   X(2,1)-----X(2,2)---...---X(2,7)
%    |          |        |      |
%   ...        ...      ...    ...
%    |          |        |      |
%   X(10,1)----X(20,2)--...---X(20,7)
%
% quadsurf(X, Y, Z, C, <parameter/value pairs>)
%
%   C is a matrix of the same size as X, Y and Z, and specifies the colour
%   of the vertices by indexing into the colormap.
%
%   The X,Y,Z,C quad can be followed by parameter/value pairs to specify
%   additional properties of the Patch, e.g. 
%
%     quadsurf(x, y, z, c, 'EdgeColor', 'white');
%
% H = quadsurf(...)
%
%   H returns a patch handle. Patches are children of AXES objects.

% patch takes quadrangles as rows of 4 elements. Here we create matrices
