function [d, dtot] = dmatrix_sphmesh(uv, tri)
% DMATRIX_SPHMESH  Sparse great-circle distance and shortest-path distance 
% matrices between the nodes of a spherical mesh
%
% [D, DTOT] = dmatrix_sphmesh(UV, TRI)
%
%   UV is a 2-column matrix where each row contains the latitude and
%   longitude coordinates of a mesh node, in radians.
%
%   TRI is a matrix where each row contains the indices of the nodes that
%   form an element in the mesh. Thus, for a triangulation, TRI has 3
%   columns, for a tetrahedral mesh, TRI has 4 columns and so on.
%
%   D is a sparse matrix. D(i,j) is the geodesic length of the spherical
%   segment between nodes i and j. The lengths are given in radians, or
%   equivalently, metres, as the sphere has radius 1. If the nodes are not
%   connected, D(i,j) is a "hole" in the matrix. Note that although under
%   Matlab sparse matrix's definition this technically means D(i,j)=0, by
%   convention in function dijkstra(), this means for us D(i,j)=Inf.
%
%   DTOT is a full matrix. DTOT(i,j) is the shortest-path length between
%   nodes i and j, using Dijkstra's algorithm. Note that if node j cannot
%   be reached from node i at all, then DTOT(i,j)=Inf. For nodes connected
%   by edges, D(i,j)=DTOT(i,j).
