function [tri, x] = delaunay_sphere(N, xi)
% DELAUNAY_SPHERE  Triangulation of a sphere or a surface topologically
% equivalent to a sphere so that it can be used as a mesh
%
% [TRI, X] = delaunay_sphere(N)
%
%   Number of samples of the sphere (in latitude and longitude).
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix with a triangulation of the sphere. Each
%   element in TRI is an index to a row in X. Each row represents the three
%   vertices of a triangle on the sphere.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix with the Euclidean coordinates of the
%   triangulation vertices.
%
%   The surface can be plotted running
%
%     trisurf(tri, x(:, 1), x(:, 2), x(:, 3));
%
% ... = delaunay_sphere(N, XI)
%
%   XI is an (N+1,N+1,3)-array with the coordinates of the vertices of a
%   surface topologically equivalent to a sphere. By default, XI is the
%   concatenation of the output of sphere(N), and the surface is a unit
%   sphere.
%
%   The surface can be plotted running
%
%     surf(xi(:, :, 1), xi(:, :, 2), xi(:, :, 3))
