function [tri, x] = tri_squeeze(tri, x)
% TRI_SQUEEZE  Remove disconnected vertices from triangular mesh
%
% [TRI2, X2] = tri_squeeze(TRI, X)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   Assuming that TRI, X represents a triangular mesh where some of the
%   vertices in X are not part of any triangle in TRI, this function
%   returns TRI2, X2, that represent the same mesh, but with the
%   disconnected vertices removed.
