function [d, dtot] = dmatrix_mesh(tri, x)
% DMATRIX_MESH  Sparse distance and shortest-path distance matrices between
% the nodes of a mesh
%
% [D, DTOT] = dmatrix_mesh(TRI)
% [D, DTOT] = dmatrix_mesh(TRI, X)
%
%   TRI is a matrix where each row contains the indices of the nodes that
%   form an element in the mesh. Thus, for a triangulation, TRI has 3
%   columns, for a tetrahedral mesh, TRI has 4 columns and so on.
%
%   X is a matrix where each row contains the real world coordinates of a
%   mesh node. Thus, for 2D points, X has 2 columns, for 3D points, 3
%   columns and so on. If X is not provided, then distances between
%   connected vertices are assumed to be 1.
%
%   D is a sparse matrix. D(i,j) is the length of the edge between nodes i
%   and j. If the nodes are not connected, D(i,j) is a "hole" in the
%   matrix. Note that although under Matlab sparse matrix's definition this
%   technically means D(i,j)=0, by convention in function dijkstra(), this
%   means for us D(i,j)=Inf.
%
%   DTOT is a full matrix. DTOT(i,j) is the shortest-path length between
%   nodes i and j, using Dijkstra's algorithm. Note that if node j cannot
%   be reached from node i at all, then DTOT(i,j)=Inf. For nodes connected
%   by edges, D(i,j)=DTOT(i,j).
