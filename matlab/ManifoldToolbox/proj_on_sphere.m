function [lat, lon, sphrad] = proj_on_sphere(x)
% PROJ_ON_SPHERE  Project a point configuration onto a sphere
%
% [LAT, LON, SPHRAD] = proj_on_sphere(X)
%
%   X is a 3-row matrix. Each colum has the (x,y,z)-coordinates of a point.
%
%   LAT, LON are vectors with the latitude and longitude of the points in X
%   projected onto a sphere. The centre of the sphere is the centroid of X.
%
%   SPHRAD is the mean of the distance of the points in X to the centroid.
%   It can be used as the radius of the sphere that best contains the
%   projection of X in terms of distances between the the points.
