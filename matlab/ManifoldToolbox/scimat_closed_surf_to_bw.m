function scimat = scimat_closed_surf_to_bw(tri, x, scimat)
% SCIMAT_CLOSED_SURF_TO_BW  Segment the inside of the triangulation of a
% closed surface
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_closed_surf_to_bw(TRI, X, SCIMAT)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix with a triangulation of a close surface. Each
%   element in TRI is an index to a row in X. Each row represents the three
%   vertices of a triangle on the surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix with the Euclidean coordinates of the
%   triangulation vertices.
%
%   SCIMAT is a struct where the result will be saved to.
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the output, where the voxels within the closed surface have
%   been set to 1. Note that these voxels are _added_ to whatever previous
%   segmentation was present in SCIMAT.
