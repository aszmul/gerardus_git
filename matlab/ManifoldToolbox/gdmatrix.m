function d = gdmatrix(lat, lon)
% GDMATRIX  Matrix of geodesic distances between points on a sphere, in
% degrees of arc
%
% D = gdmatrix(LAT, LON)
%
%   LAT, LON are vectors with the latitude and longitude coordinates of a
%   set of points on the surface of a sphere.
%
%   D is a square matrix where D(i,j) is the geodesic distance between the
%   i-th and j-th points.
