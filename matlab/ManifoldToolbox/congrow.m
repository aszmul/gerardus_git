function con2 = congrow(con)
% CONGROW  Grow the local neighbourhoods in a connectivity matrix
%
% CON2 = congrow(CON)
%
%   CON is a square connectivity matrix, typically sparse. CON(i,j)>0 means
%   that vertices i and j are connected with an edge.
%
%   CON2 is a connectivity matrix of the same size as CON. The connectivity
%   has been increased, by connecting each vertex to its neighbours'
%   neighbours. This makes the local neighbourhoods grow.
