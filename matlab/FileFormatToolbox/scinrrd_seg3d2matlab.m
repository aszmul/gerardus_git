function nrrd = scinrrd_seg3d2matlab(nrrd)
% SCINRRD_SEG3D2MATLAB  Correct dimensions of data loaded from SCI NRRD so
% that rows and columns will follow Matlab's coordinates
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_SEG3D2MATLAB(NRRD)
%
%   Seg3D displays images with x-coordinates spanning columns, and
%   y-coordinates spanning rows. However, when segmentations are exported
%   to Matlab files, it swaps this convention. Thus, when you load a
%   segmentation mask in Matlab, coordinates are inverted: x-coords span
%   rows and y-coords span columns.
%
%   This function undoes the swapping, so that the image loaded in Matlab
%   will follow the convention x <-> columns, y <-> rows.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
