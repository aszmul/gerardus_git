function scinrrd_save(file, nrrd, touint8)
% SCINRRD_SAVE  Save a NRRD struct to a Matlab format that can be imported
% by Seg3D
%
% SCINRRD_SAVE(FILE, NRRD)
%
%   This function formats the NRRD volume and saves it to a .mat file that
%   can be imported as a segmentation or opened as a volume by Seg3D.
%
%   FILE is a string with the path and name of the .mat file.
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
% SCINRRD_SAVE(FILE, NRRD, TOUINT8)
%
%   TOUINT8 is a flag to convert the image data from double to uint8. This
%   will make the volume 8 times smaller. By default, TOUINT8=false.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
