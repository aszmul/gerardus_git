function scirunnrrd = scinrrd_save(file, scirunnrrd, touint8, v73)
% SCINRRD_SAVE  Save a NRRD struct to a Matlab/MetaImage format that can be
% imported by Seg3D
%
% SCINRRD_SAVE(FILE, NRRD)
%
%   This function formats the NRRD volume and saves it to a .mat or .mha
%   file that can be imported as a segmentation or opened as a volume by
%   Seg3D.
%
%   FILE is a string with the path and name of the .mat/.mha file.
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
% SCINRRD_SAVE(FILE, NRRD, TOUINT8)
%
%   TOUINT8 is a flag to convert the image data from double to uint8. This
%   will make the volume 8 times smaller. By default, TOUINT8=false.
%
% SCINRRD_SAVE(FILE, NRRD, TOUINT8, V73)
%
%   V73 is a flag to save the data to Matlab's HDF5-based MAT file format
%   v7.3. The reason is that if you volume is >= 2GB, Matlab skips saving
%   it and gives the warning message:
%
%      "Warning: Variable 'scirunnrrd' cannot be saved to a MAT-file whose
%      version is older than 7.3.
%      To save this variable, use the -v7.3 switch.
%      Skipping..."
%
%   This is a limitation of the v7 format. Read more here
%
%      http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/rn/bqt6wls.html
%
%   However, note that Seg3D 1.x cannot read v7.3 files. By default,
%   V73=false.
%
% NRRD = SCINRRD_SAVE(...)
%
%   NRRD as an output argument gives the reformatted data volume actually
%   saved.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
