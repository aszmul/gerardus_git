function x = scinrrd_index2world(idx, ax)
% SCINRRD_INDEX2WORLD  Convert data volume indices to real world
% coordinates for NRRD volumes created by SCI applications (e.g. Seg3D)
%
%   Function SCINRRD_INDEX2WORLD() maps between the indices of the 
%   [4-D uint8] volume used to store the voxel intensity values, and the
%   real world coordinates of points within the NRRD data volume.
%
%      [r, c, s] -> [x, y, z]
%
%   Note that the row (r) index corresponds to the y-coordinate, and the
%   column (c) index corresponds to the y-coordinate.
%
%   For points that are not exactly on the centre of a voxel, the
%   coordinates are rounded to the closest centre.
%
%   For points that are not within the data volume, the returned indices
%   are "NaN".
%
% X = SCINRRD_INDEX2WORLD(IDX, AXIS)
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix where each row contains the real world
%   (x,y,z)-coordinates of a point.
%
%   IDX has the same size as X, and the voxel indices.
%
%   AXIS is the 4x1 struct array scirunnrrd.axis seen above. It contains
%   the following fields:
%
%   >> scirunnrrd.axis
%
%   4x1 struct array with fields:
%       size
%       spacing
%       min
%       max
%       center
%       label
%       unit
%
% Example:
%
% >> x = scinrrd_index2world([55, 189, 780], scirunnrrd.axis)
%
% x =
%
%     0.0100    0.0110    0.0200
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When data or label volumes are saved to a Matlab file (.mat), they use
%   a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
