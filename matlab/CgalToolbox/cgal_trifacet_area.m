function a = cgal_trifacet_area(tri, x)
% CGAL_TRIFACET_AREA  Area of the facets in a triangular mesh
%
% A = cgal_trifacet_area(TRI, X)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row contains the 3 nodes that form one
%   triangular facet in the mesh.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. X(i, :) contains the xyz-coordinates of the
%   i-th node in the mesh.
%
%   A is a vector with the same number of rows as TRI. A(i) is the area of
%   the triangle TRI(i).
