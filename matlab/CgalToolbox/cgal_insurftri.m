% CGAL_INSURFACETRIANGULATION  Find whether a point is inside or outside a
% closed surface
%
%   This function evaluates whether one or more points belong inside a
%   closed surface. First, we check whether the point is on the surface
%   itself (in that case, it's considered inside). If not, a ray is
%   projected from the point and the intersections with the surface are
%   counted. An odd number means that the point is inside. This approach
%   fails if the point is not on the surface, but the ray lies on the
%   surface or crosses a vertex, because this spans many arbitrary
%   intersections. To solve this problem, a few rays are used for each
%   point, and the majority vote decides whether it's inside or outside.
%
% ISIN = cgal_insurftri(TRI, X, XI)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the indices of the tree
%   vertices that form a triangle. TRI as a whole represents the closed
%   surface.
%
%   X is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
%   of a vertex on the surface, indexed by TRI values.
%
%   XI is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents the Carterian coordinates
%   of a point for which we want to find whether it's inside or outside the
%   closed surface.
%
%   ISIN is a boolean vector with one element per point in XI. True means
%   that the corresponding point is inside the closed surface (or on the
%   surface), and false means that it's outside.
%
% ISIN = cgal_insurftri(TRI, X, XI, DIRECTIONS, TOL)
%
%   DIRECTIONS is a 3-column matrix. Each row represents a vector with a
%   ray direction. By default, 
%
%          DIRECTIONS=[ 1.0,  0.0,  0.0; ...
%                      -1.0,  1.0,  1.0; ...
%                      -1.0, -1.0, -1.0]
%
%   This default can fail with regular voxels, as rays may cross vertices.
%   A good practical alternative is to use a few random directions, e.g.
%
%          DIRECTIONS=rand(4, 3);
%
%   TOL is a scalar with the distance tolerance. Points at distance <= TOL
%   are considered to be on the surface, and thus "inside". By default,
%   TOL=1e-15.
