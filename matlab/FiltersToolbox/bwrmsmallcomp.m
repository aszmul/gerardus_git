function bw = bwrmsmallcomp(bw, nobj)
% BWRMSMALLCOMP  Remove small connected components from a segmentation
%
%   This function is useful to remove segmentation noise.
%
% BW2 = bwrmsmallcomp(BW, NOBJ)
%
%   BW is a binary segmentation.
%
%   NOBJ is a scalar with the number of connected components we want to
%   keep. By default, NOBJ=1, and only the largest connected components is
%   kept.
%
%   BW2 is a binary segmentation with the same size as BW, but where all
%   connected components except for the NOBJ largest ones have been
%   removed.
