% MM_OPENING Mathematical Morphology operator: Opening (erosion+dilation)
% with removal of small components
%
% SEG2 = mm_opening(SEG)
%
%   SEG is a 3D volume with a binary segmentation.
%
%   SEG2 is a smoothed version of SEG, after applying an opening
%   morphological operator (erosion + dilation with radius 1).
%
% ... = mm_opening(..., RAD, N)
%
%   RAD is a scalar with the radius in voxels of the erosion and dilation.
%
%   N is a scalar with the number of largest components to keep after the
%   erosion. Eroding tends to disconnect a segmented object into several
%   components, many usually noise-like. If N<Inf, right after erosion all
%   but the N largest connected components are kept. By default, N=Inf and
%   no components are removed.
