function d = seg2dmat(im)
% SEG2DMAT  Local neighbourhood distance matrix between segmentation voxels
%
% D = SEG2DMAT(IM)
%
%   D is a sparse matrix where D(i,j) gives the distance between the i-th
%   and j-th voxels in the binary segmentation IM.
%
%   The index values i, j are computed with SUB2IND(), in the usual Matlab
%   way if you reshape IM into a vector, IM(:).
%
%   A 26-neighbourhood is assumed. That is, a voxel is only connected to
%   the 26 voxels that form a cube around it. That's why the sparse matrix
%   representation is convenient.
%
%   This function is fully vectorized and is thus very fast.
%
%   This function can be used with 2D images instead of 3D volumes too,
%   although some of the intermediate steps are not as efficient
%   memory-wise as they could be.

% compute neighbourhood with connectivity 26 around origin

dlocal = sqrt(gr.^2 + gc.^2 + gs.^2);

% convert volume of distances and coordinates into vectors

% each row has the coordinates of a neighbourhood around a segmented voxel
r = repmat(gr', length(idx), 1) + repmat(r, 1, 27);
c = repmat(gc', length(idx), 1) + repmat(c, 1, 27);

% convert out of range subscripts into NaNs, so that they are not
% considered later when computing distances

% reduce the r, c, s matrices to a single matrix with linear indices for
% the neighbours. Now, we have vector idx and matrix nn. For example:
% idx(5) = 34864
% nn(5,:) = [NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN 34395 34396 34397 ...
%            34863 34864 34865 35331 35332 35333 108807 108808 ...
%            108809 109275 109276 109277 109743 109744 109745]
% means that voxel 34864 has only 18 neighbours (voxel 34864 is in the
% first slice, so the neighbourhood is constrained that way)
nn = sub2ind(sz, r, c, s);

% we are going to remove the central column, because we don't need to
% connect a voxel to itself with distance 0
nn = nn(:, [1:13 15:end]);
dlocal = dlocal([1:13 15:end]);

% replicate local distance and index vectors so that it corresponds with
% the nn matrix
dlocal = repmat(dlocal', length(idx), 1);
idx = repmat(idx, 1, 26);

% find the not out of range connections
ok = ~isnan(nn);

% remove connections to out of range voxels
idx = idx(ok);
nn = nn(ok);
dlocal = dlocal(ok);

% create sparse matrix for distances between all voxels in the image
d = sparse(idx, nn, dlocal, N, N);

% remove the connections to voxels that are not segmented
