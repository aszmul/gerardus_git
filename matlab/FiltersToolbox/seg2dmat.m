function [d, dict, idict] = seg2dmat(im, outformat)
% SEG2DMAT  Local neighbourhood distance matrix between segmentation voxels
%
% D = SEG2DMAT(IM)
%
%   D is a sparse matrix where D(i,j) gives the distance between the i-th
%   and j-th voxels in the binary segmentation IM.
%
%   The index values i, j are computed with SUB2IND(), in the usual Matlab
%   way if you reshape IM into a vector, IM(:).
%
%   A 26-neighbourhood is assumed. That is, a voxel is only connected to
%   the 26 voxels that form a cube around it. That's why the sparse matrix
%   representation is convenient.
%
%   This function is fully vectorized and is thus very fast.
%
%   This function can be used with 2D images instead of 3D volumes too,
%   although some of the intermediate steps are not as efficient
%   memory-wise as they could be.
%
% [D, DICT, IDICT] = SEG2DMAT(IM, OUTFORMAT)
%
%   OUTFORMAT is a string. By default, D(i,j) gives the distance between
%   voxels i and j in IM. However, for large image volumes, it can be more
%   convenient to compute a smaller D where D(m, n) is the distance between
%   the m-th and n-th voxels of the segmentation:
%
%     'im' (default): Indices correspond to the whole image volume.
%
%     'seg': Indices correspond only to the segmentation (smaller matrix).
%
%   DICT and IDICT are column vectors used to convert to whole image and
%   segmentation indices. If OUTFORMAT='im', then i==j, so there's no need
%   for conversion and DICT and IDICT are returned empty.
%
%     DICT(i) is the matrix index for voxel i in the image
%     IDICT(i) is the image index for matrix index i.
