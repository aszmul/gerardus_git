function itk_imfilter
% ITK_IMFILTER: Run ITK filter on a 2D or 3D image
%
% This function is a multiple-purpose wrapper to be able to run all
% ITK filters that inherit from itk::ImageToImageFilter on a Matlab
% 2D image or 3D image volume.
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER(TYPE, A)
%
%   TYPE is a string with the filter we want to run. Currently, only
%   the following options are implemented:
%
%     'skel': (BinaryThinningImageFilter3D) Skeletonize a
%             segmentation mask
%
%   A is a 2D matrix or 3D volume with the image or
%   segmentation. Currently, A can be of any of the following
%   Matlab classes:
%
%     boolean
%     double
%     single
%     int8
%     uint8
%     int16
%     uint16
%     int32
%     int64
%
%   B has the same size and class as A, and contains the filtered
%   image or segmentation mask.
%
% This function must be compiled before it can be used from Matlab.
% If Gerardus' root directory is e.g. ~/gerardus, type from a
% linux shell
%
%    $ cd ~/gerardus/matlab
%    $ mkdir bin
%    $ cd bin
%    $ cmake ..
%    $ make install
%
% If cmake throws an error because it cannot find Matlab, then edit
% gerardus/matlab/CMakeLists.txt, and where it says
%
%    SET(MATLAB_ROOT "/usr/local/matlab/R2010b/")
%
%  change to your own Matlab root path.
