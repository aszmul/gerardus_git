function [sk, cc] = skeleton_label(sk, im, res)
% SKELETON_LABEL  Give each branch of a skeleton a different label
%
% [LAB, CC] = SKELETON_LABEL(SK)
%
%   SK is a 3D segmentation mask. SK is assumed to be a skeleton resulting
%   from some kind of thinning algorithm, e.g. the C++ program
%   skeletonize3DSegmentation provided by Gerardus. That is, the
%   segmentation looks like a series of 1 voxel-thick branches connected
%   between them (cycles are allowed).
%
%   LAB is an image of the same dimensions of SK where the value of each
%   voxel is the label of the branch it belongs to.
%
%   Voxels in bifurcations are labelled as the nearest branch. Voxels
%   completely surrounded by other bifurcation voxels are assigned the
%   nearest label arbitrarily. Some voxels may remain unlabelled, e.g. if
%   they are not connected to any others in the segmentation.
%
%   CC is a struct like those provided by Matlab's function bwconncomp().
%   Each vector in CC.PixelIdxList{i} has the list of image indices of the
%   voxels with label i.
%
% ... = SKELETON_LABEL(SK, IM, RES)
%
%   IM is the original 3D the skeleton SK was computed from. In this case,
%   LAB has the labelling of IM. If you want to extract the labelling for
%   SK, just run
%
%     >> LAB .* SK
%
%   RES is a 3-vector with the voxel size as [row, column, slice]. By
%   default, RES=[1 1 1].

%% Labelling of the skeleton

% get sparse matrix of distances between voxels. To label the skeleton we
% don't care about the actual distances, just need to know which voxels are
% connected to others. Actual distances will be needed if we have to
% segment the original segmentation, though

% compute degree of each voxel
deg = sum(d > 0, 2);
