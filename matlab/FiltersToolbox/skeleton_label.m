% SKELETON_LABEL  Give each branch of a skeleton a different label, and
% sort the voxels within each branch
%
% [LAB, CC] = SKELETON_LABEL(SK)
%
%   SK is a 3D segmentation mask. SK is assumed to be a skeleton resulting
%   from some kind of thinning algorithm, e.g. the C++ program
%   skeletonize3DSegmentation provided by Gerardus. That is, the
%   segmentation looks like a series of 1 voxel-thick branches connected
%   between them (cycles are allowed).
%
%   LAB is an image of the same dimensions of SK where the value of each
%   voxel is the label of the branch it belongs to.
%
%   Voxels in bifurcations are labelled as the nearest branch. Voxels
%   completely surrounded by other bifurcation voxels are assigned the
%   nearest label arbitrarily. Some voxels may remain unlabelled, e.g. if
%   they are not connected to any others in the segmentation.
%
%   CC is a struct like those provided by Matlab's function bwconncomp().
%   Each vector in CC.PixelIdxList{i} has the indices of all the voxels in
%   branch i. These indices are image indices, so the row, column, slice
%   coordinates of e.g. branch 5 can be obtained doing
%
%     [r, c, s] = ind2sub(size(sk), cc.PixelIdxList{5});
%
%   We have added new fields to CC:
%
%     CC.PixelParam{i}: parameterization values for the voxels in
%                       cc.PixelIdxList{i}. The parameterization is
%                       computed as the accumulated chord distance between
%                       consecutive branch voxels. This parameterization
%                       can be used, e.g. for spline interpolation.
%                       Branches that contain a loop cannot be
%                       parameterized as a 1-D spline, and thus
%                       CC.PixelParam(i)=NaN
%
%     CC.IsLeaf(i):     flags indicating whether each section is a "leaf",
%                       i.e. whether it's a branch with a free extreme
%
%     CC.IsLoop(i):     flags indicating whether each section is a "loop",
%                       i.e. whether it's a branch around a hole
%
%     CC.BranchLength(i): chord-length of each skeleton branch. This is a
%                         parameterization of the branch's skeleton as a
%                         1-D spline. Branches that contain a loop cannot
%                         be parameterize, and thus CC.IsLoop(i)=NaN
%
%     CC.BranchNeighbours{i}: branch labels that share a bifurcation point
%                             with i
%
%     CC.BifurcationPixelIdx{i}: indices of the bifurcation voxels for
%                                branch i. Empty if the branch is "floating
%                                in the air" and doesn't have any
%                                bifurcation points
%
%     CC.Degree{i}:      degree of each skeleton voxel, i.e. how many voxel
%                        it is connected to
%
%     CC.MergedBranches{i}: only available if branch merging is selected by
%                           setting ALPHA>=0. Gives the list of branches in
%                           the pre-merged skeleton that were merged to
%                           create branch i
%
%   There may be a small discrepancy between cc.PixelIdxList and the voxels
%   labelled in LAB. The reason is that:
%
%     - We impose each branch to have two termination voxels. Termination
%     voxels can be leaves or bifurcation points. Bifurcation points can be
%     shared by more than one branch, so in that case they need to be
%     repeated in CC, while in SK the bifurcation voxel is assigned to only
%     one branch.
%
%     - Some bifurcation voxels are completely surrounded by other
%     bifurcation voxels. The former are not included in CC, but they are
%     given a label in SK.
%
% [LAB, CC, D, DICT, IDICT] = SKELETON_LABEL(SK)
%
%   D is the sparse distance matrix between skeleton points.
%
%   DICT, IDICT are vectors to convert between image and distance matrix
%   indices. i=DICT(I), I=IDICT(i), where I is an image linear index, and i
%   is a distance matrix index, i.e. you use them e.g. SK(I) or D(i, :).
%
% ... = SKELETON_LABEL(SK, IM, RES)
%
%   IM is the original 3D the skeleton SK was computed from. In this case,
%   LAB has the labelling of IM. If you want to extract the labelling for
%   SK, just run
%
%     >> LAB .* SK
%
%   RES is a 3-vector with the voxel size as [row, column, slice]. By
%   default, RES=[1 1 1].
%
% ... = SKELETON_LABEL(SK, IM, RES, ALPHAMAX, P)
%
%   ALPHAMAX is a scalar. ALPHAMAX >= 0 means that each branch end will be
%   merged with one of its neighbours if the angle between both is 
%   <= ALPHAMAX (radians). This is a way to get the same label for all the
%   segments that result from a long branch having lateral secondary
%   branches. By default ALPHAMAX = -1, so no merging is performed. As a
%   rule of thumb, ALPHAMAX = 10/180*pi seems to work well.
%
%   P is a scalar in [0, 1]. To compute the angle between branches, an
%   approximating or smoothing cubic spline is fit to the skeleton voxels
%   using csaps(..., P). P=0 is the smoothest spline (a line with the least
%   squares approximation), while P=1 is a rugged spline (the spline
%   interpolated the voxels). Adequate values of P depend on the image
%   resolution, so it's difficult to propose a formula. For resolution in
%   the order of 2.5e-5, P=.999999 seems to give good results (note that
%   for small resolution, P=.999999 gives a very different result to
%   P=1.0). For resolution in the order of 1, P=0.8 seems to give good
%   results. By default, P=0.8.
