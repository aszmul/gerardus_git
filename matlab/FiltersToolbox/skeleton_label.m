function [sk, cc, bifcc, mcon, madj, cc2, mmerge] = skeleton_label(sk, im, res, alphamax, p, SINGLEMERGE, CORRECT)
% SKELETON_LABEL  Give each branch of a skeleton a different label, and
% sort the voxels within each branch
%
% [LAB, CC, BIFCC, MCON, MADJ] = SKELETON_LABEL(SK, [], RES)
%
%   SK is a 3D segmentation mask. SK is assumed to be a skeleton resulting
%   from some kind of thinning algorithm, e.g. 
%     >> sk = itk_filter('skel', im);
%   (itk_filter() is a Matlab function provided by Gerardus). That is, the
%   segmentation looks like a series of 1 voxel-thick branches connected
%   between them (cycles are allowed).
%
%   RES is a 3-vector with the voxel size as [row, column, slice]. By
%   default, RES=[1 1 1].
%
%   LAB is an image of the same dimensions of SK where the value of each
%   voxel is the label of the branch it belongs to.
%
%   Voxels in bifurcations are labelled as the nearest branch. Voxels
%   completely surrounded by other bifurcation voxels are assigned the
%   nearest label arbitrarily.
%
%   CC is a struct like the one provided by Matlab's function bwconncomp(),
%   but with some extra fields
%
%     CC.PixelIdxList{i}: list of connected voxels that form the i-th
%                       branch. These indices are image indices, so the
%                       row, column, slice coordinates of e.g. branch 5 can
%                       be obtained doing
%
%                         [r, c, s] = ind2sub(cc.ImageSize, cc.PixelIdxList{5});
%
%     CC.PixelParam{i}: parameterization values for the voxels in
%                       cc.PixelIdxList{i}. The parameterization is
%                       computed as the accumulated chord distance between
%                       consecutive branch voxels. This parameterization
%                       can be used, e.g. for spline interpolation.
%
%     CC.IsLeaf(i):     flags indicating whether each section is a "leaf",
%                       i.e. whether it's a branch with a free extreme
%
%     CC.BranchLength(i): chord-length of each skeleton branch. This is a
%                       parameterization of the branch's skeleton as a
%                       1-D spline.
%
%     CC.Degree{i}:     degree of each branch voxel, i.e. how many voxels
%                       it is connected to.
%
%   BIFCC is a struct a bit like CC, but only with field PixelIdxList
%
%     BIFCC.PixelIdxList{i}: list of connected voxels that form the i-th
%                       bifurcation clump.
%
%   MCON is a boolean sparse matrix, where rows = branches, columns =
%   bifurcation clumps. MCON(5, 2)==true means that branch 5 is connected
%   to bifurcation clump 2.
%
%   MADJ is a square sparse matrix where MADJ(7, 3)==10 means that branches
%   7 and 3 and connected through the bifurcation clump 10.
%
%
% [LAB, ...] = SKELETON_LABEL(SK, IM, RES)
%
%   IM is an array with the same size as SK, and contains the whole
%   segmentation. SK is the skeleton of IM.
%
%   If IM is provided, then LAB will contain IM labelled, instead of SK
%   labelled. IM is labelled using a region grow algorithm on the labelled
%   skeleton. If you want to extract the labelling for SK, just run
%
%     >> LAB .* SK
%
% [..., CC2] = SKELETON_LABEL(SK, IM, RES, ALPHAMAX, P, SINGLEMERGE, CORRECT)
%
%   With this syntax you can merge branches that are well aligned with each
%   other.
%
%   ALPHAMAX is an angle in radians. ALPHAMAX >= 0 means that branch
%   merging is performed. If the angle between those two branches is <=
%   ALPHAMAX, then they are merged. By default ALPHAMAX = -Inf, so no
%   merging is performed.
%
%   P is a scalar in [0, 1]. To straighten branches, an approximating or
%   smoothing cubic spline is fitted to the skeleton voxels using
%   csaps(..., P). P=0 is the smoothest spline (a line with the least
%   squares approximation), while P=1 is a rugged spline (the spline
%   interpolated the voxels). Adequate values of P depend on the image
%   resolution, so it's difficult to propose a formula. For resolution in
%   the order of 2.5e-5, P=.999999 seems to give good results (note that
%   for small resolution, P=.999999 gives a very different result to
%   P=1.0). For resolution in the order of 1, P=0.8 seems to give good
%   results. By default, P=1 and no smoothing is performed.
%
%   SINGLEMERGE is a boolean flag. If SINGLEMERGE=true, then at each
%   bifurcation clump only the two branches with the smallest angle between
%   them are considered for merging. If SINGLEMERGE=false, then any pair of
%   branches with an angle smaller than ALPHAMAX will be merged. By
%   default, SINGLEMERGE=true.
%
%   CORRECT is the proportion of voxels in each branch that will be
%   corrected with respect to its secondary branches using a region grow
%   algorithm. For example, CORRECT=0.9 means that main branches will be
%   grown from their skeleton until at most 90% of their voxels are
%   selected. The overlap is removed from secondary branches and labelled
%   as belonging to the main branch. By default, CORRECT=0.0 and no
%   correction is performed.
%
%   Note: If you want to see how branches are being merged and smoothed,
%   uncomment the DEBUG block at the end of internal function
%   angle_btw_branches().
%
%   CC2 is a struct like CC, but with two additional fields
%
%     CC2.MergedBranches{i}: List of branches in the pre-merged skeleton
%                      that were merged to create branch i
%
%     CC2.MergedBifClumps{i}: List of bifurcation clumps that were merged
%                      to create branch i
