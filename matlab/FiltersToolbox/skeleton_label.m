function [im, cc] = skeleton_label(im)
% SKELETON_LABEL  Give each branch of a skeleton a different label
%
% [LAB, CC] = SKELETON_LABEL(IM)
%
%   IM is a 3D segmentation mask. IM is assumed to be a skeleton resulting
%   from some kind of thinning algorithm, e.g. the C++ program
%   skeletonize3DSegmentation provided by Gerardus. That is, the
%   segmentation looks like a series of 1 voxel-thick branches connected
%   between them (cycles are allowed).
%
%   LAB is an image of the same dimensions of IM where the value of each
%   voxel is the label of the branch it belongs to.
%
%   Voxels in bifurcations are labelled as the nearest branch. Voxels
%   completely surrounded by other bifurcation voxels are assigned of the
%   the nearest labels arbitrarily.
%
%   CC is a struct like those provided by Matlab's function bwconncomp().
%   Each vector in CC.PixelIdxList{i} has the list of image indices of the
%   voxels with label i.
