function im = labmathmorph(type, im, param)
% LABMATHMORPH  Mathematical morphology operators on a labelled
% segmentation, one label at a time
%
% This function runs mathematical morphology operations (dilation, erosion,
% opening, closing) on labelled segmentations. The operator is applied to
% each label independently. Care has been taken speed up operations for
% large images.
%
% IM2 = LABMATHMORPH(TYPE, IM, PARAM)
%
%   TYPE is a string with the operator name:
%
%     * 'dilate': Binary dilation
%
%     * 'erode': Binary erosion
%
%     * 'open': Erosion followed by dilation
%
%     * 'close': Dilation followed by erosion (i.e. smoothing)
%
%   IM is a 2D or 3D volume with the labelled segmentation. All voxels with
%   the same value will be considered to belong to the same label.
%
%   PARAM is a value or vector with the parameter(s) values for the
%   operator. See below for details.
%
% IM2 = LABMATHMORPH('dilate', IM, NDIL)
%
% IM2 = LABMATHMORPH('erode', IM, NERO)
%
% IM2 = LABMATHMORPH('close', IM, [NDIL NERO])
%
% IM2 = LABMATHMORPH('open', IM, [NERO NDIL])
%
% where NDIL, NERO are the radii to dilate and erode, respectively, in
% voxel units.
