function im = gmthr_seg(im, nobj, nsubs)
% GMTHR_SEG  Segment an image estimating threshold as intersection of two
% Gaussians from Gaussian mixture model
%
% BW = gmthr_seg(IM)
%
%   IM is an input n-dim image. This function assumes that IM contains a
%   darker object over a brighter background.
%
%   BW is an output segmentation mask, where voxels == true correspond to
%   the darker object.
%
%   A Gaussian mixture model is fitted to the image intensities, and the
%   intersection point between the Gaussian maxima is computed. The oject
%   in the image is segmented using this intersection value as the
%   segmentation threshold. Finally, all segmented objects are removed
%   except for the largest one. This last step is useful to remove
%   segmentation noise.
%
% ... = gmthr_seg(..., NOBJ, NSUBS)
%
%   NOBJ is a scalar. Only the largest NOBJ are kept in the segmentation.
%   By default, NOBJ = 1.
%
%   NSUBS is a scalar. For large images, the variance estimate will be too
%   small for the Gaussian mixture fitting function, which will return an
%   error. This problem can be solved doing a random subsampling of the
%   image to estimate the Gaussian mixture model. NSUBS is the subsampling
%   factor. E.g. NSUBS=100 will randomly sample numel(IM)/NSUBS voxels in
%   the image. By default, NSUBS=1 and no subsampling is performed.
