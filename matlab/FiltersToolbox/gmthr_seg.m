function [thr, q, obj, im] = gmthr_seg(im, nobj, nsubs)
% GMTHR_SEG  Segment an image estimating threshold as intersection of two
% Gaussians from Gaussian mixture model
%
% THR = gmthr_seg(IM)
%
%   IM is an input n-dim image. This function assumes that IM contains a
%   darker object over a brighter background.
%
%   THR is a scalar with the estimated threshold value between dark
%   voxels (object) and lighter voxels (background). A Gaussian mixture
%   model is fitted to the image intensities, and the intersection point
%   between the Gaussian maxima is computed. The object in the image is
%   segmented using this intersection value as the segmentation threshold.
%
%   If the object and the background are too similar compared to the number
%   of samples in the image (i.e. the Gaussians intersect outside of the
%   interval between the Gaussian maxima), then this method cannot provide
%   a threshold to separate object and background. In that case, THR is
%   returned as NaN. This is the case, for example, if the image only
%   contains background, or only object voxels.
%
% [THR, Q, OBJ, BW] = gmthr_seg(IM, NOBJ, NSUBS)
%
%   NOBJ is a scalar. Only the largest NOBJ are kept in the segmentation.
%   This last step is useful to remove segmentation noise. By default,
%   NOBJ=1.
%
%   NSUBS is a scalar. For large images, the variance estimate will be too
%   small for the Gaussian mixture fitting function, which will return an
%   error. This problem can be solved doing a random subsampling of the
%   image to estimate the Gaussian mixture model. NSUBS is the subsampling
%   factor. E.g. NSUBS=100 will randomly sample numel(IM)/NSUBS voxels in
%   the image. By default, NSUBS=1 and no subsampling is performed.
%
%   Q is a quality measure of the threshold. Q takes values in [0, 1].
%   Values close to 0 mean that both Gaussians have a lot of overlap, so
%   the threshold between object and background cannot be trusted very
%   much. Values close to 1 mean that both Gaussians are well separated,
%   and the threshold value can be trusted to provide a good segmentation.
%
%   OBJ is the Gaussian mixture object. See help('gmdistribution.fit') for
%   details. The mean and variance of the Gaussians can be extracted as
%   obj.mu and obj.Sigma, respectively.
%
%   BW is an output segmentation mask, where voxels == true correspond to
%   the darker object.
