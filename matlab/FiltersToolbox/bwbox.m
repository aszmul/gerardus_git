% BWBOX  Find tight box around segmentation (and possibly add a margin)
%
% IDX = bwbox(BW)
%
%   BW is a segmentation volume of any number of dimensions. Voxels with 
%   value 0 belong to the background, and anything else, to the object.
%
%   IDX is a matrix where each row contains the first and last indices of
%   foreground voxels along the corresponding dimension. All indices
%   together form a hyperdimensional box that tighly contains the object.
%
% IDX = bwbox(BW, M)
%
%   M is a scalar. The box will be expanded by M voxels in each dimension.
