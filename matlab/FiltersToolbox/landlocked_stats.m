function stats = landlocked_stats(lab, d, dict)
% LANDLOCKED_STATS  Assess whether sections of voxels are surrounded by
% other sections (land) or by background (water)
%
% STATS = LANDLOCKED_STATS(LAB, D, DICT)
%
%   LAB is a segmentation where background voxels have value 0, and the
%   rest of voxels are partitioned in sections, each with a different
%   value. All the voxels within the same section share the same value.
%
%   D is a sparse or full distance matrix where D(i,j)>0 means that voxels
%   i and j are connected.
%
%   DICT is a sparse vector to convert from image linear indices to matrix
%   D indices.
%
%   D and DICT can be computed with function seg2dmat().
%
%   STATS is a struct with the results:
%
%     STATS.islandlocked: bool to tell whether the corresponding section is
%                         landlocked
%
%     STATS.nbound:       number of voxels in the outer boundary of the
%                         section
%
%     STATS.nwater:       number of voxels in the outer boundary that are
%                         touching the background
