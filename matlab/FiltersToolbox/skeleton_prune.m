function nrrdsk = skeleton_prune(nrrdsk, cc, minlen)
% SKELETON_PRUNE  Prune branches in a segmentation's skeletonization
%
% NRRDPR = SKELETON_PRUNE(NRRDSK, CC, MINLEN)
%
%   NRRDSK is an SCI NRRD struct. NRRD.data contains the result of running
%   a skeletonization algorithm on a binary segmentation, e.g.
%
%     >> nrrdsk.data = itk_imfilter('skel', nrrd);
%
%   CC is a struct produced by function skeleton_label().
%
%   MINLEN is a scalar with the minimum length in voxels for a leaf. Any
%   leaf shorter than MINLEN will be pruned.
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
