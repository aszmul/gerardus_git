function im2 = blockproc3(im, blksz, fun, border, useparallel)
% BLOCKPROC3  Block processing for a 3D image
%
% Sometimes images are too large to be processed in one block. Matlab
% provides function blockproc(), that works on 2D images only. This
% blockproc3() function, on the other hand, works also with 3D images.
%
% The original Matlab function blockproc() can run processing in parallel
% (if the ). This function doesn't
% support that functionality yet.
%
% IM2 = blockproc3(IM, BLKSZ, FUN)
%
%   IM is a 2D or 3D-array with a grayscale image.
%
%   BLKSZ is a 2- or 3-vector with the size of the blocks the image will be
%   split into. The last block in every row, column and slice will be
%   smaller, if the image cannot accommodate it.
%
%   FUN is a function handle. This is the processing applied to every
%   block.
%
% IM2 = blockproc3(IM, BLKSZ, FUN, BORDER)
%
%  BORDER is a 2- or 3-vector with the size of the border around each
%  block. Basically, each block size will be grown by this amount, the
%  block processed, and then the border cut off from the solution. This is
%  useful to avoid "seams" in IM2.
%
% Example:
%
%       fun = @(x) deconvblind(x, ones(20, 20, 10));
%       im2 = blockproc3d(im, [256 256 128], fun, [30 30 10]);
%
% IM2 = blockproc3(..., PARALLEL)
%
%   PARALLEL is a boolean flag to activate parallel processing if the
%   Parallel Computing Toolbox is available, and a worker pool has been
%   opened. When PARALLEL=true, all workers will process blocks in
%   parallel (default: PARALLEL=false).
%
%   Parallel processing works by first splitting the image into blocks and
%   storing them in a cell array, then processing each block, and finally
%   reassembling the cell array into the output image.
%
%   This will increase the amount of necessary memory. Speed improvements
%   may not be as good as expected, as Matlab function can be already more
%   or less optimised to make use of several processors.
%
%   To use this option, first it's necessary to create a pool of workers in
%   Matlab. You can find more information in Matlab's documentation (e.g.
%   help matlabpool). A simple example:
%
%      % median filtering using a 19x19x19 voxel neighbourhood, processing
%      % the image by blocks, using parallel computations
%      matlabpool open
%      sz = [19 19 19];
%      fun = @(x) medfilt3(x, sz);
%      im2 = blockproc3(im, [128 128 64], fun, (sz+1)/2, true);
%      matlabpool close
