% SCINRRD_CROP  Crop an SCI NRRD image or segmentation volume
%
% NRRD2 = SCINRRD_CROP(NRRD, FROM, TO)
%
%   NRRD is an SCI NRRD image or segmentation volume.
%
%   FROM, TO are vectors with the index coordinates that define the
%   cropping box. For example, FROM=[2 3 7], TO=[15 20 22].
%
%   NRRD2 is the cropped volume.
