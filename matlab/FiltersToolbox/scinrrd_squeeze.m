%
%   NRRD is an SCI NRRD image volume struct. Even if the data is 3D, the
%   struct adds a dummy dimension. This function removes it, so that
%   indices are more intuitive (e.g., x-coordinates are data(:, , ) instead
%   of data( , :, , )
%
%   TODOUBLE is a flag to convert the image data from uint8 to double. This
%   is useful for image processing, but the data will be 8 times larger. By
%   default, TODOUBLE=false.
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
