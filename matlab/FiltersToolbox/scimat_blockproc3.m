function scimat2 = scimat_blockproc3(scimat, blksz, fun, border, useparallel)
% SCIMAT_BLOCKPROC3  Block processing for a 3D SCI MAT volume
%
% Sometimes images are too large to be processed in one block. Matlab
% provides function blockproc(), that works on 2D images only. This
% scimat_blockproc3() function, on the other hand, works also with 3D SCI
% MAT images.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_blockproc3(SCIMAT, BLKSZ, FUN)
%
%   SCIMAT is a 2D or 3D SCI MAT volume with the input grayscale image.
%
%   SCIMAT2 is the ouput image, processed by blocks, with the same size as
%   SCIMAT.
%
%   BLKSZ is a 2- or 3-vector with the size of the blocks the image will be
%   split into. The last block in every row, column and slice will be
%   smaller, if the image cannot accommodate it.
%
%   FUN is a function handle. This is the processing applied to every
%   block.
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_blockproc3(SCIMAT, BLKSZ, FUN, BORDER)
%
%  BORDER is a 2- or 3-vector with the size of the border around each
%  block. Basically, each block size will be grown by this amount, the
%  block processed, and then the border cut off from the solution. This is
%  useful to avoid "seams" in SCIMAT2.
%
% Example:
%
%       fun = @(x) deconvblind(x, ones(20, 20, 10));
%       im2 = blockproc3d(im, [256 256 128], fun, [30 30 10]);
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_blockproc3(..., PARALLEL)
%
%   PARALLEL is a boolean flag to activate parallel processing if the
%   Parallel Computing Toolbox is available. When PARALLEL=true, all cores
%   available locally will start processing the blocks in the image (note
%   that the Parallel Computing Toolbox can only use up to 4 cores at the
%   same time, so if your machine has e.g. 6 cores, 4 cores will be used
%   and 2 cores will remain inactive). Default: PARALLEL=false.
%
%   Note that in parallel model, FUN gets wrapped in parallel jobs. Thus,
%   execution can be interrupted by pressing CTRL+C even when FUN is a C++
%   MEX file.
%
%   Parallel processing works by first splitting the image into blocks with
%   borders, assigning processing of each block to a separate job, then
%   processing each block, and finally trimming the borders and
%   reassembling the results into the output image.
%
%   This will increase the amount of necessary memory, but this function is
%   relatively efficient in the sense that only blocks being processed take
%   up extra memory (blocks waiting in the job queue don't). 
%
%   The speed improvement may not be as good as expected (e.g. 4 processor
%   will make the processing only 2x faster), as Matlab function can be
%   already more or less optimised to make use of several processors.
%
%   To use this option, it is important to NOT have created a pool of
%   workers in Matlab with "matlabpool open", as this would block all local
%   resources, and not leave any cores free for processing the image
%   blocks. A simple example:
%
%      % median filtering using a 19x19x19 voxel neighbourhood, processing
%      % the image by blocks, using parallel computations
%      sz = [19 19 19];
%      fun = @(x) medfilt3(x, sz);
%      scimat2 = blockproc3(scimat, [128 128 64], fun, (sz+1)/2, true);
