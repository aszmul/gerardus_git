% Note: Old implementation of function
% scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane(). Backup while we transition to

%
% SCINRRD_OPTIMAL_INTERSECTING_PLANE  Optimise intersection plane for SCI
% NRRD segmentation mask
%
% [VOPT, MOPT, AVALS, VVALS, MVALS] = SCINRRD_OPTIMAL_INTERSECTING_PLANE(NRRD, Z0, V0, RAD)
%
%   This function computes the plane that intersects a SCI NRRD
%   segmentation mask in a way that minimizers the segmentation area
%   intersected by the plane. That is, in some sense in finds the plane
%   more orthogonal to the segmented volume.
%
%   (Note that the area is computed on the convex hull of the plane
%   intersection with the volume.)
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
%   Z0 is a z-coordinate value. The rotation centroid for the plane will be
%   at Z0 height.
%
%   V0 is a 3-vector that describes the normal vector to the initial
%   intersecting plane. By default, the initial plane is horizontal.
%
%   RAD can be a scalar or 2-vector:
%     scalar:   RAD is the radius of a 2D smoothing disk. The 2D image
%               obtained from intersecting the 3D volume by the plane at
%               each optimization iteration will be smoothed out using the
%               disk before computing the area.
%     2-vector: The smoothing element is a 3D ball. Instead of smoothing
%               a 2D image at each iteration, the whole 3D image volume is
%               smoothed with the ball at the beginning. RAD(1) is the ball
%               radius in the XY-plane. RAD(2) is the ball height.
%
%   VOPT is the normal vector that describes the plane at centroid MOPT so
%   that the intersection area is minimised.
%
%   AVALS is a vector with the record of area values from the optimization.
%
%   VVALS is a matrix with the record of normal vectors to the plane from
%   the optimization.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
