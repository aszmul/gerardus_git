% IMBLEND  Blend two image stacks to increase the apparent dynamic range
% and improve the signal to noise ratio
%
% A common problem in photography or microscopy is trying to image a target
% with strong contrast. If the settings are optimised for the highlights,
% information is lost as the shadow areas get underexposed. On the other
% hand, if the settings are optimised for the shadows, information is lost
% when the highlights get overblown.
%
% The most widely used method to deal with this problem in digital cameras
% is auto-bracketing. The camera takes several images at different light
% settings, and then blends them in an intelligent way to increase the
% apparent dynamic range of the sensor.
%
% This function implements a blending function for two images to increase
% the apparent dynamic range by removing under- and over-exposed voxels,
% and also improves the signal to noise ratio of the final image.
%
% IM = IMBLEND(IM1, IM2)
%
%   IM1, IM2 are 3D arrays with two images of the same scene. The images
%   may have been taken at different light settings, or with the same ones.
%
%   IM is the output 3D array that results from blending the input images.
%
% [IM, A0] = IMBLEND(IM1, IM2)
%
%   A0 is the scaling factor such that IM*A0 is closest in intensity values
%   to IM2, once saturated and underexposed voxels are removed.
