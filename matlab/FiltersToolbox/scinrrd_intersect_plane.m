% SCINRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE  Intersection of a plane with an image volume
%
% [IM, GX, GY, GZ, MIDX] = SCINRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE(NRRD, M, V)
%
%   IM is an image that displays the intersection of the plane with the
%   image volume in SCI NRRD format. Voxels that fall outside the image
%   volume are returned as NaN.
%
%   GX, GY, GZ are matrices of the same size as IM, and contain the
%   Cartesian coordinates of the voxels in IM. You can visualize the
%   resulting plane using
%
%     >> surf(gx, gy, gz, im, 'EdgeColor', 'none')
%
%   The plane is uniquely defined in 3D space using a point and a vector:
%
%     * M is a 3-vector with the coordinates of a point contained in the
%       plane. It is assumed that M is within the image boundaries
%   
%     * V is a 3-vector that represents a normalized vector orthogonal to
%       the plane
%
%   MIDX is a 2-vector with the row and colum of M in the intersecting
%   plane. That is, the X, Y, Z coordinates of M are
%
%     [gx(midx(1), midx(2)), ...
%      gy(midx(1), midx(2)), ...
%      gz(midx(1), midx(2))]
%
% ... = SCINRRD_INTERSECT_PLANE(NRRD, M, V, INTERP)
%
%   INTERP is a string with the interpolation method when sampling the
%   volume with the plane:
%
%     'nn' (default): nearest neighbour. Good for binary segmentation masks
%     'linear': linear interpolation. Good for grayscale images
%   
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
