function im = img_tps_map(s, t, im)
% IMG_TPS_MAP Warp an image using a thin-plate spline transformation
%
% IM2 = IMG_TPS_MAP(S, T, IM)
%
%   IM is an image.
%
%   S is a (P,Ds,N)-volume where each (:,:,i)-matrix has the coordinates
%   of the source points that define the warp.
%
%   T is a (P,Dt,N)-volume where each (:,:,i)-matrix has the coordinates
%   of the target points that define the warp.
%
%     (P is the number of points, Ds and Dt are the dimension and N is the
%     number of configurations).
%
%   Note that the thin-plate spline (TPS) warp is defined from the target
%   to the source image. So the warp applied to the source image is the
%   inverse of the TPS, that has no known explicit formulation (in
%   particular, the inverse of a TPS is not a TPS).

% get image size

% create uniform grid for the target image
[gy, gx] = ndgrid(1:nr, 1:nc);

% warp grid points. The way to do this is warp the target uniform grid onto
% the source image. Ideally, we would like to warp with the inverse of the
% TPS, but there is no known expression for it. So the only thing we can do
% is to warp the grid with the TPS from target to source. Thus, the image
% will be warped from the source to the target using the implicit inverse
% of the TPS
gxyw = pts_tps_map(t, s, [gx(:) gy(:)]);

% resize grid points
gxw = reshape(gxyw(:, 1), [nr, nc]);
gyw = reshape(gxyw(:, 2), [nr, nc]);
clear gxyw;

% interpolate intensity values in the target image
im = interpn(gy, gx, im, gyw, gxw, 'linear');
