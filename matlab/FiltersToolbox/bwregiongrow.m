function bwregiongrow
% BWREGIONGROW  Fast region grow labelling of binary image from multiple
% seeds
%
% LAB = BWREGIONGROW(IM, TODO)
%
%   IM is a 2D matrix or 3D array with a multi-label segmentation. That is,
%   IM contains a background and several objects, each object represented
%   by all the connected voxels with the same label.
%
%   IM can have any Matlab numeric type (double, uint8, etc).
%
%   Numerical voxel values in IM are interpreted in the following way:
%
%     0:               background voxel, don't label
%     TODO:            this voxel needs to be labelled using the region
%                      grow algorithm
%     Any other value: this voxel is a seed, and its value will be
%                      propagated using the region grow algorithm
%
%   LAB has the same size as IM, and has the label values that partition
%   the original binary image IM. Each partition has a different label.
%   Partitions are computed with a region grow algorithm that expands the
%   labels from the seeds.
%
%   At each iteration, partitions grow 1 voxel until the whole IM is
%   labelled.
%
% LAB = BWREGIONGROW(..., RES, MAXITER)
%
%   RES is a 2-vector (in 2D) or 3-vector (in 3D) with the voxel size in
%   each dimension. By default, it is assumed that RES=[1, 1, 1]. Voxel
%   size is used to compute distances between voxels in the labelling
%   process.
%
%   MAXITER is a scalar to tell the algorithm to stop after a number of
%   region grow iterations. If MAXITER < 0, the algorithm iterates until
%   all TODO voxels have been labelled. By default, MAXITER = -1.
