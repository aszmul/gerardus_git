function im = bwregiongrow(im, seed, res)
% BWREGIONGROW  Region grow segmentation of binary image from multiple
% seeds
%
% LAB = BWREGIONGROW(IM, SEED)
%
%   IM is a 2D matrix or 3D array with a binary segmentation.
%
%   SEED has the same size as IM, and contains the initial seed values for
%   the segmentation. For example, if SEED(45)=3, this means that voxel 45
%   in IM has label 3.
%
%   LAB has the same size as IM, and has the label values that partition
%   the original binary image IM. Each partition has a different label.
%   Partitions are computed with a region grow algorithm that expands the
%   labels from the seeds.
%
%   At each iteration, partitions grow 1 voxel until the whole IM is
%   labelled.
%
% LAB = BWREGIONGROW(..., RES)
%
%   RES is a 2-vector (in 2D) or 3-vector (in 3D) with the voxel size in
%   each dimension. By default, it is assumed that RES=[1, 1, 1]. Voxel
%   size is used to compute distances between voxels in the labelling
%   process.
