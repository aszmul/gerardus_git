function box = scinrrd_box(nrrd, m, a)
% SCINRRD_BOX  Compute tight box around SCI NRRD segmentation
%
% X = SCINRRD_BOX(NRRD, M, A)
%
%   This function finds the vertices of a box tangent to the edges of a
%   segmentation. The box can be vertical or have any other orientation.
%
%   NRRD is the SCI NRRD struct.
%
%   X is a (3, 8)-matrix with the coordinates of the box vertices.
%
%   M is a 3-vector with the coordinates of the rotation centre. By
%   default, M=[0 0 0].
%
%   A is a (3, 3)-rotation matrix, in case the data has to be rotated
%   before computing the box. By default, A is the identity matrix and no
%   rotation is performed. To be consistent with the ITK (Insight Toolkit)
%   convention, the A matrix has to be the "backwards transformation", i.e.
%   A is the rotation from output to input voxel coordinates.
%
%   The "backwards transformation" is the transpose of the forward
%   transformation. For example, in this toolbox the backwards
%   transformation is obtained with function 
%
%     scinrrd_vertical_rot3(nrrd,'img')
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
