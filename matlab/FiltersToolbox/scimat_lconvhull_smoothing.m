function scimat = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(scimat, alpha)
% SCIMAT_LCONVHULL_SMOOTHING  Smoothing of a binary image using a local
% convex hull
%
% SCIMAT2 = scimat_lconvhull_smoothing(SCIMAT, ALPHA)
%
%   SCIMAT is a SCI MAT volume with a binary image.
%
%   The perimeter voxels of the image are selected. The alpha-shape of
%   their coordinates produces a mesh triangulation with the local convex
%   hull.
%
%   ALPA is a scalar with the radius of the alpha shape, i.e. the size of
%   the convex hull neighbourhood. When the convex hull is computed, only
%   voxels within ALPHA distance can be connected. When ALPHA=Inf, the
%   convex hull is obtained.
%
%   The inside of the triangulation is converted to voxels using
%   cgal_insurftri().
%
%   ALPHA2 is the same SCI MAT volume with the local convex hull of SCIMAT.
%
% This function uses alphavol() by Jonas Lundgren.
%
