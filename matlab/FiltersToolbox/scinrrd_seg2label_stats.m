function stats = scinrrd_seg2label_stats(nrrd, cc, d, dict)
% SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS  Shape stats for each object in a multi-label
% segmentation; objects can be straightened with an skeleton or medial line
% before computing some measures
%
%   This function was developed to measure the dimensions of different
%   objects found in a segmentation. 
%
%   Each voxel in the input segmentation has to be labelled as belonging to
%   the different objects or the background.
%
%   Boundary voxels are counted to assess whether each label is next to the
%   background ("water"), or interior ("landlocked").
%
%   This function then computes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
%   voxels of each object, to estimate the variance in the 3 principal
%   directions, var(1), var(2) and var(3).
%
%   If the object is e.g. a cylindrical vessel with elliptical
%   cross-section, the length and the 2 main diamters of the cylinder can
%   be estimated as
%
%      L = sqrt(12 * var(1))
%      d1 = sqrt(16 * var(2))
%      d2 = sqrt(16 * var(3))
%
%   Because vessels are quite often curved or bent, and this gives
%   misleading values of variance, the function can also straighten the
%   objects using a skeleton or medial line prior to computing PCA.
%
%   If the branches are straightened, note that the returned variance
%   values are not necessarily in largest to smallest order, but:
%
%     var(1): eigenvector that is closest to the straightened skeleton
%     var(2): largest of the remaining eigenvalues
%     var(3): smallest of the remaining eigenvalues
%
%   Boundary voxel counting is performed without straightening the labels.
%
% STATS = SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS(NRRD)
%
%   NRRD is an SCI NRRD struct with a labelled segmentation mask.
%
%   All voxels in nrrd.data with value 0 belong to the background. All
%   voxels with value 1 belong to object 1, value 2 corresponds to object
%   2, and so on.
%
%   STATS is a struct with the shape parameters computed for each object in
%   the segmentation. The measures provided are
%
%     STATS.var: Variance in the three principal components of the cloud
%                of voxels that belong to each object. These are the
%                ordered eigenvalues obtained from computing Principal
%                Component Analysis on the voxel coordinates.
%
%     STATS.islandlocked: bool to tell whether the corresponding section is
%                         landlocked
%
%     STATS.nbound:       number of voxels in the outer boundary of the
%                         section
%
%     STATS.nwater:       number of voxels in the outer boundary that are
%                         touching the background
%
%   If an object has no voxels, the corresponding STATS values are NaN.
%
% STATS = SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS(NRRD, CC)
%
%   If CC is provided, then the function straightens each object before
%   computing PCA.
%
%   CC is a struct produced by function skeleton_label() with the list of
%   skeleton voxels that belongs to each object, and the parameterization
%   vector for the skeleton.
%
%   The labels can be created, e.g.
%
%     >> nrrd = seg;
%     >> [nrrd.data, cc] = skeleton_label(sk, seg.data, [seg.axis.spacing]);
%
%     where seg is an NRRD struct with a binary segmentation, and sk is the
%     corresponding skeleton, that can be computed using
%
%     >> sk = itk_imfilter('skel', seg.data);
%
% STATS = SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS(..., D, DICT)
%
%   D is the sparse distance matrix for adjacent voxels in the
%   segmentation. DICT is the dictionary vector to convert between image
%   linear indices and distance matrix indices. They can be computed using
%
%     >> [d, dict] = seg2dmat(seg.data, 'seg', [seg.axis.spacing]);
%
%   If they are not provided externally, they are computed internally.
%
