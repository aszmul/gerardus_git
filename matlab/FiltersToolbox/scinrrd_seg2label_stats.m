% SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS  Shape stats for each label in a multi-label
% segmentation
%
% STATS = SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS(NRRD, CC)
%
%   NRRD is an SCI NRRD struct with a labelled segmentation mask of
%   different structures, e.g. blobs, tubes, etc.
%
%   CC is a struct produced by function skeleton_label() with the list of
%   skeleton voxels that belongs to each label, and the parameterization
%   vector for the skeleton.
%
%   The labels can be created, e.g.
%
%     >> [nrrd.data, cc] = skeleton_label(sk.data, seg.data, [seg.axis.spacing]);
%
%     where seg.data is a binary segmentation mask of all the image,
%     sk.data is a binary segmentation mask of the skeleton.
%
%   STATS is a struct with the shape parameters computed for each label in
%   the segmentation. The provided measures are:
%
%     STATS.VAR: Variance in the three principal components of the cloud
%                of voxels that belong to each label. These are the
%                ordered eigenvalues obtained from computing Principal
%                Component Analysis on the voxel coordinates.
%
% STATS = SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS(..., STRAIGHT)
%
%   STRAIGHT is a flag. If STRAIGHT=true, then each label is warped so that
%   its skeleton becomes a straight line before computing the shape stats.
%
%   This is very useful if you have bent tubular structures in the image
%   (e.g. blood vessels) and you want to estimate the length and
%   cross-section diameters of the tube. By default, STRAIGHT=false.
%
% STATS = SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS(..., D, DICT)
%
%   D is the sparse distance matrix for adjacent voxels in the
%   segmentation. DICT is the dictionary vector to convert between image
%   linear indices and distance matrix indices. They can be computed using
%
%     >> [d, dict] = seg2dmat(seg.data, 'seg', [seg.axis.spacing]);
%
%   If they are not provided externally, they are computed internally by
%   the function.
