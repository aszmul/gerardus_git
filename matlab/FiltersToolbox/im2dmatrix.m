function a = im2dmatrix(im)
% IM2DMATRIX  Sparse distance matrix between 2D or 3D image voxels,
% weighted by voxel intensities
%
% A = im2dmatrix(IM)
%
%   IM is an image volume with dimensions (R, C, S).
%
%   A is a sparse matrix with dimensions (R*C*S, R*C*S), where element
%   (i,j) is the mean intensity between voxels with linear indices i and j.
%
%   Voxels with an Inf intensity are skipped.
%
% ... = im2dmatrix(..., RES) [This option only available in the MEX version]
%
%   RES is a row vector with the voxel size of [row, column, slice] (2D) or
%   [row, column, slice] (3D). By default, RES=[1.0 1.0 1.0].
%
%   This function has a slow Matlab implementation (using loops), but a
%   fast MEX version is provided with Gerardus too.
