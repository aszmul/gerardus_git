% SCINRRD_NDGRID  Generation of arrays for 3D SCI NRRD image volumes
%
% [XG, YG, ZG] = SCINRRD_NDGRID(NRRD)
%
%   NRRD is a SCI image volume.
%
%   XG, YG, ZG are arrays with the x-, y-, z-coordinates of the voxels in
%   NRRD.
%
%   Note that XG values change with columns, and YG values change with
%   rows, to accommodate the usual coordinate frame convention.
