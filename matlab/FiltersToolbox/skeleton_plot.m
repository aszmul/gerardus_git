function skeleton_plot(cc, lab, varargin)
% SKELETON_PLOT  Plot a labelled segmentation and its skeleton
%
% SKELETON_PLOT(CC, LAB)
%
%   CC and LAB are the outputs from function skeleton_label().
%
%   This function plots the branches from the skeleton with the two end
%   points of each one (note than several branches can share the same end
%   point). If LAB is provided and not empty, the branches are plotted on
%   the labelled segmentation.
%
% SKELETON_PLOT(CC, LAB, ...)
%
%   It is possible to add more input arguments, that will be passed to the
%   plot functions. See 'help plot' for the available options.
%
% See also: skeleton_label.
