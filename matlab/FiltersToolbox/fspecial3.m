function h = fspecial3(type, sz, param)
% FSPECIAL3  Create predefined 3-dimensional filters
%
% H = FSPECIAL3(TYPE, SZ, PARAM)
%
%   H is a 3-dimensional (3D) filter of TYPE:
%
%     'gaussian'  Rotationally symmetric Gaussian low-pass filter (default)
%                 PARAM: standard deviation in each dimension (default
%                 PARAM = [1.0 1.0 1.0])
%
%   SZ is a vector with the size of the output filter in each dimension, in
%   order [rows, columns, slices]. By default, SZ = [3 3 3]. Sizes have to
%   be odd numbers so that the filter can be centered around 0.
