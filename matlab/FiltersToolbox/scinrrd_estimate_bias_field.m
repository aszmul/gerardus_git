function nrrd = scinrrd_estimate_bias_field(nrrd, x, k)
% SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD  Estimate MRI bias field
%
%   This function provides an estimate of the bias field from a magnetic
%   resonance image (MRI).
%
%   The function samples an SCI NRRD image in locations provided by the
%   user (typically, corresponding to background voxels), and then creates
%   another image that interpolates the sampled intensity values.
%
%   The locations can be selected e.g. using our Spline Tool extension to
%   the Seg3D platform (click the points, and then export the control
%   points).
%
%   Note that because the interpolant is an interpolating thin-plate
%   spline (TPS), this function is not robust in the presence of noise
%   (this can be solved e.g. by low-pass filtering the image). Ideally, in
%   the future this function should use an approximating TPS instead of an
%   interpolating one.
%
% NRRD2 = SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD(NRRD, X)
%
%   NRRD is an image provided in SCI NRRD format.
%
%   X is a 3-colum matrix with the real world coordinates of the sampling
%   points. Note that each point is rounded to the closest voxel centre.
%
%   NRRD2 is the estimated bias field in SCI NRRD format.
