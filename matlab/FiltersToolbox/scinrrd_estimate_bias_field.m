function nrrd = scinrrd_estimate_bias_field(nrrd, x, a)
% SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD  Estimate MRI bias field
%
%   This function provides an estimate of the bias field from a magnetic
%   resonance image (MRI).
%
%   The function samples an SCI NRRD image in locations provided by the
%   user (typically, corresponding to background voxels), and then creates
%   another image that interpolates the sampled intensity values.
%
%   The locations can be selected e.g. using our Spline Tool extension to
%   the Seg3D platform (click the points, and then export the control
%   points).
%
%   Note that because the interpolant is an interpolating thin-plate
%   spline (TPS), this function is not robust in the presence of noise
%   (this can be solved e.g. by low-pass filtering the image). Ideally, in
%   the future this function should use an approximating TPS instead of an
%   interpolating one.
%
% NRRD2 = SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD(NRRD, X)
%
%   NRRD is an image provided in SCI NRRD format.
%
%   X is a 3-colum matrix with the real world coordinates of the sampling
%   points. Note that each point is rounded to the closest voxel centre.
%
%   NRRD2 is the estimated bias field in SCI NRRD format.
%
% NRRD2 = SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD(NRRD, X, A)
%
%   A is a scaling factor. Because using the TPS to interpolate all voxels
%   can be rather slow, and the bias field is anyway a slow varying field,
%   it's convenient to first quickly reduce the image size by A (using
%   bilinear interpolation), interpolate the bias field in the smaller
%   image with the TPS, and then expand to the original size. By default, A
%   = 1.0 and no rescaling is used.
