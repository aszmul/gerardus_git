% DECONVOLVE  MEX interface to the Clarity deconvolution library
%
% This function provides a Matlab MEX interface to the Clarity
% Deconvolution Library [1] developed by CISMM, UNC [2].
%
% Clarity uses by default one thread per processor. In a 4-processor
% machine, we have observed typical run times 1/2 to 1/3 of Matlab's native
% deconvolution algorithms (e.g. deconvwnr, deconvlucy).
%
% Clarity provides a CUDA implementation too. To enable it, read the
% documentation in the wiki:
%
% http://code.google.com/p/gerardus/wiki/EnablingCUDA
%
% A = DECONVOLVE(ALGO, B, PSF)
%
%   The working hypothesis is that we want to recover A from
%
%     B = convolution(A, PSF) + noise
%
%   ALGO is a string that selects the deconvolution method:
%
%     'w': Clarity_WienerDeconvolve. Wiener filter deconvolution. Matlab
%     equivalent deconvwnr().
%
%     'jvc': Clarity_JansenVanCittertDeconvolve. Classic Jansen-van Cittert
%     formulation for constrained iterative deconvolution.
%
%     'ml': Clarity_MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve. Maximum-likelihood
%     deconvolution method cited in [3].
%
%   B is the observed image, affected by blurring and noise. B is typically
%   a 2- or 3-dimensional array.
%
%   PSF is an array with an estimate of the point spread function (PSF).
%
%   A is the deconvolved image. A is an array with the same dimensions as
%   B.
%
% A = DECONVOLVE('w', B, PSF, EPSILON)
%
%   EPSILON is a scalar. From the Clarity documentation: "Constant standing
%   in place of the ratio between power spectra of noise and the power
%   spectra of the underlying image, which are unknown parameters. In
%   practice, acts as a smoothing factor. Typically set in the range 0.001
%   to 0.1". By default, EPSILON=0.01.
%
% A = DECONVOLVE('jvc', B, PSF, ITER)
% A = DECONVOLVE('ml', B, PSF, ITER)
%
%   ITER is a scalar. Number of iterations for the algorithm. By default,
%   ITER=10.
