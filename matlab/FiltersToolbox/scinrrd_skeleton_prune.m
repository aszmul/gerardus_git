% SCINRRD_SKELETON_PRUNE  Prune branches in a segmentation's skeletonization
%
% This function prunes the leaves of a segmentation skeleton in three
% steps:
%
%   1. Remove clumps of voxels
%
%   2. Prune very short leaves (iteratively until no more leaves can be
%      pruned)
%
%   3. Prune leaves created by artifacts in the segmentation. Spurious
%      leaves are those roughly as long as the local radius of the main
%      branch they are attached to (iteratively until no more leaves can
%      be pruned)
%
%
% NRRDPR = SCINRRD_SKELETON_PRUNE(NRRDSK)
% NRRDPR = SCINRRD_SKELETON_PRUNE(NRRDSK, [], MAXCLUMP, MINLEN)
%
%   This syntax runs steps 1 and 2 only.
%
%   NRRDSK is an SCI NRRD struct. NRRDSK.data contains the result of
%   running a skeletonization algorithm on a binary segmentation NRRD,
%   e.g.
%
%     >> nrrdsk = nrrd;
%     >> nrrdsk.data = itk_imfilter('skel', nrrd);
%
%   MINLEN is a scalar with the minimum length in voxels for a leaf. Any
%   leaf shorter than MINLEN will be pruned. By default, MINLEN = 5 voxel.
%
%
% NRRDPR = SCINRRD_SKELETON_PRUNE(NRRDSK, NRRD, MAXCLUMP, MINLEN, LRATIO, ALPHAMAX, P)
%
%   This syntax runs steps 1, 2 and 3.
%
%   NRRD is the binary segmentation mentioned above.
%
%   LRATIO is a scalar. Leaves with L/R < LRATIO will be pruned, where
%   L is the length from the bifurcation to the tip of the leaf. By
%   default, LRATIO=1.2.
%
%   ALPHAMAX and P are merging parameters. See the help of function
%   skeleton_label for details. If merging is not enabled, then no leaves
%   will be pruned in step 3.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []
