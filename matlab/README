	 gridfit: estimates a surface on a 2d grid, based on scattered data

	          generate the surface, where the bias is toward smoothness.
	 
	          Gridfit is not an interpolant. Its goal is a smooth surface
	          that approximates your data, but allows you to control the
	          amount of smoothing.
