CardiacToolbox:
===============

correct_rv_crescent_tips.m

	Correct the segmentation of the Right Ventricle's crescent
	tips using the segmentation of the tricuspid and pulmonary
	annula.

crest_envelope.m

	Compute the envelope for the Right Ventricle's crest.

is_lv_on_the_left

	Check whether the left ventricle is on the left hand side of
	the image.

process_misas_patient.m

	Create MetaImage volumes from directory tree of IMA DICOM
	files, for project with human hearts provided by Kelvin Wong.

scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips

	Extract the tips of the crescent-shaped curve in all slices of
	the Right Ventricle.

scinrrd_valve_surface

	Inter atrio-ventricular surface.

FileFormatToolbox:
==================

dcm2mat

	If you have a bunch of DICOM (.dcm) files, one per slice, and
	you want to create a single Matlab (.mat) file with all the
	slices collated together. It attempts to detect time series
	too, and in that case, it creates a 4D matrix.

dcm2metaimage

	If you have a bunch of DICOM (.dcm) files, one per slice, and
	you want to create a single MetaImage file with all the slices
	collated together. Note that a MetaImage file in fact is split
	into a header file (.mha) and a data file (.raw).

im2metaimage

	If you have a bunch of image files (e.g. TIFF, PNG, JPG,
	etc.), one per slice, and you want to create a single
	MetaImage file with all the slices collated together. Note
	that a MetaImage file in fact is split into a header file
	(.mha) and a data file (.raw).

matlab2vox_seg3d

	Convert Matlab file with Seg3D segmentation to .vox format (for
	the Tarantula meshing application).

scinrrd_index2world

	Convert data volume indices to real world coordinates for NRRD
	volumes created by SCI applications (e.g. Seg3D).

scinrrd_load

	Load a NRRD struct saved to Matlab or MetaImage format.

scinrrd_save

	Save a NRRD struct to a Matlab format that can be imported by
	Seg3D.

scinrrd_seg3d2matlab

	Correct dimensions of data loaded from SCI NRRD so that rows
	and columns will follow Matlab's coordinates.

scinrrd_world2index

	Convert real world coordinates to data volume indices for NRRD
	volumes created by SCI applications (e.g. Seg3D).

sortdirbynum

	List the files in a directory ordering them by a numerical
	substring field in the file name. This function is useful  to
	determine the order in which slices will be collated when you
	have filenames like
	MISAS_DT_22_10_2009.MR.HEAD_GENERAL.6.10.2009.10.23.16.02.38.562500.9699412.BMP.
