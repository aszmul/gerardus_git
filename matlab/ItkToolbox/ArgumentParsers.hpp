/*
 * ArgumentParsers.hpp
 *
 * parseInputTypeToTemplate()
 * parseOutputTypeToTemplate< InVoxelType >()
 * parseFilterTypeToTemplate< InVoxelType, OutVoxelType >()
 *
 * These functions are used to be able to map between the input/output
 * data types that are only know at run-time, and the input/output
 * data templates that ITK requires and must be know at compilation
 * time.
 *
 * To avoid a nesting nightmare:
 *
 * switch FilterType {
 *   switch InputDataType {
 *     switch OutputDataType {
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * we split the conversion in 3 steps. The first function,
 * parseInputTypeToTemplate() reads the input data type and the
 * filter type, and instantiates
 * parseOutputTypeToTemplate<InVoxelType>() for each input data
 * type.
 *
 * This way, we have effectively mapped the input type from a run-time
 * variable to a set of compilation time templates.
 *
 * Then parseOutputTypeToTemplate<InVoxelType>() decides on the
 * output data type depending on the filter and the input, and
 * instantiates one
 * parseFilterTypeToTemplate<InVoxelType, OutVoxelType>() for each
 * output data type.
 *
 * This way, we have instantiated all combinations of input/output
 * data types, without having to code them explicitly.
 *
 * Finally, parseFilterTypeToTemplate<InVoxelType, OutVoxelType>()
 * checks that the requested filter is implemented and maps the filter
 * variable to all filter templates.
 *
 * Note that the actual filtering is done in the constructor of
 * BaseFilter, that is instantiated from
 * parseFilterTypeToTemplate.
