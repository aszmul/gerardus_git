function im = itk_imfilter(~, ~)
% ITK_IMFILTER: Run ITK filter on a 2D or 3D image
%
% This MEX function is a multiple-purpose wrapper to be able to run
% all ITK filters that inherit from itk::ImageToImageFilter on a
% Matlab 2D image or 3D image volume.
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER(TYPE, A)
%
%   TYPE is a string with the filter we want to run. Currently, only
%   the following options are implemented:
%
%     'skel':    (BinaryThinningImageFilter3D) Skeletonize a
%                binary mask
%
%                B has the same size and class as A
%
%     'dandist': (DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter) Compute unsigned
%                distance map for a binary mask. Distance values are
%                given in voxel coordinates
%
%                B has the same size as A. B has a type large enough
%                to store the maximum distance in the image. The
%                largest available type is double. If this is not
%                enough, a warning message is displayed, and double
%                is used as the output type
%
%     'maudist': (SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter) Compute signed
%                distance map for a binary mask. Distance values are
%                given in real world coordinates, if the input image
%                is given as an NRRD struct, or in voxel units, if
%                the input image is a normal array. The output type
%                is always double.
%
%   A is a 2D matrix or 3D volume with the image or
%   segmentation. Currently, A can be of any of the following
%   Matlab classes:
%
%     boolean
%     double
%     single
%     int8
%     uint8
%     int16
%     uint16
%     int32
%     int64
%
%   A can also be a SCI NRRD struct, A = nrrd, with the following fields:
%
%     nrrd.data: 2D or 3D array with the image or segmentation, as above
%     nrrd.axis: 3x1 struct array with fields:
%       nnrd.axis.size:    number of voxels in the image
%       nnrd.axis.spacing: voxel size, image resolution
%       nnrd.axis.min:     real world coordinates of image origin
%       nnrd.axis.max:     ignored
%       nnrd.axis.center:  ignored
%       nnrd.axis.label:   ignored
%       nnrd.axis.unit:    ignored
%
%   An SCI NRRD struct is the output of Matlab's function
%   scinrrd_load(), also available from Gerardus.
%
%   B has the same size and class as the image in A, and contains the
%   filtered image or segmentation mask.
%
% This function must be compiled before it can be used from Matlab.
% If Gerardus' root directory is e.g. ~/gerardus, type from a
% linux shell
%
%    $ cd ~/gerardus/matlab
%    $ mkdir bin
%    $ cd bin
%    $ cmake ..
%    $ make install
