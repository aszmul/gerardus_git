function im = itk_imfilter(~, ~)
% ITK_IMFILTER: Run ITK filter on a 2D or 3D image
%
% This MEX function is a multiple-purpose wrapper to be able to run
% all ITK filters that inherit from itk::ImageToImageFilter on a
% Matlab 2D image or 3D image volume.
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER(TYPE, A, [FILTER PARAMETERS])
%
%   TYPE is a string with the filter we want to run. See below for a whole
%   list of options.
%
%   A is a 2D matrix or 3D volume with the image or
%   segmentation. Currently, A can be of any of the following
%   Matlab classes:
%
%     boolean
%     double
%     single
%     int8
%     uint8
%     int16
%     uint16
%     int32
%     int64
%
%   A can also be a SCI NRRD struct, A = nrrd, with the following fields:
%
%     nrrd.data: 2D or 3D array with the image or segmentation, as above
%     nrrd.axis: 3x1 struct array with fields:
%       nnrd.axis.size:    number of voxels in the image
%       nnrd.axis.spacing: voxel size, image resolution
%       nnrd.axis.min:     real world coordinates of image origin
%       nnrd.axis.max:     ignored
%       nnrd.axis.center:  ignored
%       nnrd.axis.label:   ignored
%       nnrd.axis.unit:    ignored
%
%   (An SCI NRRD struct is the output of Matlab's function scinrrd_load(),
%   also available from Gerardus.)
%
%   [FILTER PARAMETERS] is an optional list of parameters, specific for
%   each filter. See below for details.
%
%   B has the same size as the image in A, and contains the filtered image
%   or segmentation mask. It's type depends on the type of A and the filter
%   used, and it's computed automatically.
%
%
% Supported filters:
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER('skel', A)
%
%   (itk::BinaryThinningImageFilter3D) Skeletonize a binary mask
%
%   B has the same size and class as A
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER('dandist', A)
%
%   (itk::DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter) Compute unsigned distance map
%   for a binary mask. Distance values are given in voxel coordinates
%
%   B has the same size as A. B has a type large enough to store the
%   maximum distance in the image. The largest available type is double. If
%   this is not enough, a warning message is displayed, and double is used
%   as the output type
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER('maudist', A)
%
%   (itk::SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter) Compute signed distance map
%   for a binary mask. Distance values are given in real world coordinates,
%   if the input image is given as an NRRD struct, or in voxel units, if
%   the input image is a normal array. 
%
%   The output type is always double.
%
% B = ITK_IMFILTER('bwdilate', A, RADIUS, FOREGROUND)
%
%   (itk::BinaryDilateImageFilter). Binary dilation. The structuring
%   element is a ball.
%
%   RADIUS is a scalar with the radius of the ball in voxel units. If a
%   non-integer number is provided, then floor(RADIUS) is used. By default,
%   RADIUS = 0 and no dilation is performed.
%
%   FOREGROUND is a scalar. Voxels with that value will be the only ones
%   dilated. By default, FOREGROUND is the maximum value allowed for the
%   type, e.g. FOREGROUND=255 if the image is uint8. This is the default in
%   ITK, so we respect it.
%
%   Note: If you pass an image that is not boolean, e.g. uint8, with the
%   segmented voxels set to "1", as usual, and run
%
%     >> im2 = itk_imfilter('bwdilate', im, 3);
%
%   then im won't be dilated, because by default FOREGROUND=255. You need
%   to specify
%
%     >> im2 = itk_imfilter('bwdilate', im, 3, 1);
%   
%
% This function must be compiled before it can be used from Matlab.
