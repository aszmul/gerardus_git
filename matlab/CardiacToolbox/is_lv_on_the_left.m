% FLAG = IS_LV_ON_THE_LEFT(NRRD, M, ROT)
%
%   NRRD is a struct with the whole tissue segmentation.
%
%   M, ROT are a 3-vector and a (3, 3)-matrix that represent the centroid
%   and main axes of the heart, respectively.
%
%   FLAG is a boolean. It is true of the left ventricle is on the left hand
%   side of the image with respect to the coordinate system defined by ROT.
%
%
%   Note on SCI NRRD: Software applications developed at the University of
%   Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, e.g. Seg3D,
%   internally use NRRD volumes to store medical data.
%
%   When label volumes (segmentation masks) are saved to a Matlab file
%   (.mat), they use a struct called "scirunnrrd" to store all the NRRD
%   information:
%
%   >>  scirunnrrd
%
%   scirunnrrd = 
%
%          data: [4-D uint8]
%          axis: [4x1 struct]
%      property: []

% cut a whole tissue plane orthogonal to the vertical axis
im = scinrrd_intersect_plane(nrrd, m, rot(:, 3));

% the computed "X axis" of the orientation can be pointing more or less in
% the direction of of X or -X. We compute the angle
alpha = acosd(dot(rot(:, 1), [1 0 0]'));

% now we rotate the intersected plane to get an idea of whether the LV is
% going to be on the left or right hand side of the rotated volume
im = imrotate(im, alpha);

% label connected components
[lab, nlabs] = bwlabel(~im);

% get number of voxels in each label
nvox = zeros( nlabs, 1 );
for L = 1:nlabs
    nvox(L) = sum( lab(:) == L );
end

% sort labels by decreasing size
[nvox, idx] = sort(nvox, 1, 'descend');

% the largest component is the background; the 2nd and 3rd largest should
% be the RV and LV, in either order

% compute the eccentricity of each label (the opposite of the roundness)
stat2 = regionprops(double(lab == idx(2)), 'Eccentricity');
stat3 = regionprops(double(lab == idx(3)), 'Eccentricity');

% we vote whether the 2nd largest component is actually the RV: it is more
% eccentric
if (stat2.Eccentricity > stat3.Eccentricity)
    idxrv = idx(2);
    idxlv = idx(3);
else
    idxrv = idx(3);
    idxlv = idx(2);
end

% get the centroids of both components
crv = regionprops(double(lab == idxrv), 'Centroid');
clv = regionprops(double(lab == idxlv), 'Centroid');

% is the LV placed on the left hand side?
flag = clv.Centroid(1) < crv.Centroid(1);
