function [im, LV, RV, BKG, TODO] = tissue2lvrv(im, surf, RAD, blksz, border, numworkers)
% TISSUE2LVRV  Extract LV and RV cavities from tissue and atrioventricular
% surface segmentations
%
% This function takes at the input a segmentation of the cardiac muscle and
% a segmentation of the atrioventricular surface (or any other upper limit
% for the ventricles), and returns 
%
% [LVRV, LV, RV, BKG] = tissue2lvrv(TIS, SURF)
%
%   TIS and SURF are segmentation volumes of the same size. TIS contains a
%   segmentation of the cardiac tissue, and SURF a segmentation of the
%   atrioventricular surface (AVS). This surface is a natural way to set a
%   boundary to the ventricular cavities.
%
%   LVRV is a segmentation volume of the same size as TIS and SURF. It
%   contains the segmentations of the left ventricle (LV) and right
%   ventricle (RV) cavities, and the background.
%
%   LV, RV, BKG are scalars with the labels of each output segmentation:
%   LV = left ventricle cavity, RV = right ventricle cavity, BKG =
%   background.
%
% [..., TODO] = tissue2lvrv(..., RAD, BLKSZ, BORDER, NUMWORKERS)
%
%   RAD is a scalar. Quite often, the AVS is too thin to separate the
%   ventricles from the background, and segmentation errors may connect the
%   ventricles between them or to the background. In order to segment the
%   cavities, all the background is eroded by radius RAD, and the AVS is
%   dilated by radius RAD too. By default, RAD = 2.
%
%   BLKSZ, BORDER, NUMWORKERS are parameters to run the last part of the
%   algorithm in parallel by blocks. BLKSZ is a 3-vector with the size in
%   voxels of each block the segmentation will be split into. BORDER is a
%   3-vector with the overlap in voxels between blocks. NUMWORKERS is a
%   scalar with the maximum number of cores the algorithm is allowed to
%   use. By default, BLKSZ=SIZE(TIS) and no parallel processing is used. By
%   default too, BORDER=[0 0 0], NUMWORKERS=1.
%
%   TODO is the label of voxels that were not labelled by the algorithm.
%   This can happen with parallel processing, as each block can split the
%   segmentation into non-connected components.
%
%   Note that parallel processing is possible by selecting BLKSZ smaller
%   than the volume size, even if NUMWORKERS=1.
