function [con, bnd] = tri_qcqp_smacof_nofold_2d_pip(tri, ymin, ymax, amin, amax, isFree, y)
% TRI_QCQP_SMACOF_NOFOLD_2D_PIP  Constraints in PIP format for QCQP-SMACOF
% to ensure that a 2D triangular mesh has no fold-overs.
%
% This function generates the linear and quadratic constraints that can be
% passed to qcqp_smacof() to map a triangular mesh onto 2D without
% fold-overs or, equivalently, untangle a 2D projection of a mesh.
%
% [LB, UB, W, A, RL, RU, QC] 
%   = tri_qcqp_smacof_nofold_2d(TRI, YMIN, YMAX, AMIN, AMAX)
%
%   TRI is a 3-column matrix with a surface mesh triangulation. Each row
%   gives the indices of one triangle. The mesh needs to be a 2D manifold,
%   that can be embedded in 2D or 3D space. All triangles must be oriented
%   counter-clockwise (2D space) or with the normals pointing outwards (3D
%   space).
%
%   YMIN, YMAX are 2-vectors that bound the output variables. That is, once
%   the QCQP problem is solved, all the output points will be within a box
%   with bottom-left and top-right coordinates YMIN and YMAX, respectively.
%
%   AMIN, AMAX are scalars with the minimum and maximum area allowed for
%   each output triangle, respectively.
%
%   LB, UB are matrices with the same size as Y. They provide lower and
%   upper bounds, respectively, for the corresponding coordinates.
%
%   W is a weight matrix the same size as D. W_ij = 0 means that the
%   distance between points i and j does not affect the stress measure. All
%   weights between connected nodes are 1.
%
%   A, RL, RU are a matrix and two vectors, respectively, that provide the
%   linear constraints for the SCIP quadratic program objective function, 
%   RL <= A * Y <= RU. In this case, A = [], as this problem does not
%   require linear constraints.
%
%   QC is a struct with the quadratic constraints for the SCIP quadratic
%   program, each of the form qrl <= y' * Q * y + l' * x <= qru. Its fields
%   are:
%
%     'Q': cell vector. Each cell contains the Q matrix for a quadratic
%           constraint.
%     'l': matrix. Each column contains the l vector for a quadratic
%           constraint.
%     'qrl': vector. Each element is the lower bound of a quadratic
%          constraint.
%     'qul': vector. Each element is the upper bound of a quadratic
%          constraint.
%
% ... = tri_qcqp_smacof_nofold_2d(..., ISFREE, Y)
%
%   ISFREE is an boolean N-vector, where N is the number of vertices in the
%   mesh. ISFREE(i)==true means that the i-th vertex is a free vertex (i.e.
%   an unknown in the QCQP problem). ISFREE(i)==false means that the i-th
%   vertex is a fixed vertex (i.e. with known constant coordinates). By
%   default, all vertices are assumed to be free.
%
%   Y is an (N, 2)-matrix that provides the coordinates of the fixed
%   vertices as Y(ISFREE, :). The values Y(~ISFREE, :) are simply ignored.
%   Thus, Y doesn't need to be provided if all vertices are free. If
%   there's at least a fixed vertex, then Y must be provided.
